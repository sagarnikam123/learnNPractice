# 4.5. pass Statements

# The pass statement does nothing. It can be used when a statement is required
# syntactically but the program requires no action.

while True:
    pass    # Busy-wait for keyboard interrupt (Ctrl + C)

class MyEmptyClass:
    pass

def initlog(*args):
    pass # Remember to implement this !
