# Parse the Expressions

#   Micro recently bought a digital calculator, and being an avid mathematician, started playing with it.
#   Vasya sees Micro with his new calculator, and gets amused seeing its amazing features. She being a tester
#   decides to try and thoroughly test its abilities.
#   The calculator has an output screen and 8 buttons, 4 of them for numbers from 0 to 3, and 4 for the +, −, ∗
#   and / operators. On being given a mathematical expression, it first checks whether the expression is valid,
#   and on being so, it evaluates the expression and prints it to output. If the expression is invalid,
#   it prints "Math Error" to the output screen. A Mathematical expression is considered to be invalid
#   if it starts or ends with an operator, or when 2
#   or more operators occur in succession.
#
#   Vasya did initially decide to test this calculator's abilities, however, she is now finding it impossible
#   to think to cases to test it. So, to help her, you now need to provide test cases of mathematical expressions
#   to check the calculator's abilities.
#   On the first line print the number of test-cases you are going to try and print. You should print no more than 50
#   test cases. Each test cases should be no longer than 10 characters. You should try and cover
#   as many cases as possible to test this calculator and shall be given a score on the basis of these cases.
#   Each expression printted should only consist of the 8
#   possible symbols present on the calculator, otherwise you shall be given a Wrong Answer Verdict.
#
#   Sample Output :
#   2
#
#   0+1+2+3
#
#   0-1-2-3
#
#   As these are only few of many valid test-cases you shall get only a few points for it.
