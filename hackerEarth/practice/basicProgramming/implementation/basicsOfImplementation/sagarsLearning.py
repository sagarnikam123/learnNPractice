# Sagar's Learning

#######################################################################################################################
#
#   Sagar is good mathematician as well as CSE student and has learned few concepts such as HCF and LCM.
#   Now, to test his learning , his room-mate Mohith gave him a number N and asked him to give biggest possible
#   HCF that can be obtained by 3 numbers less than or equal to N (All 3 numbers need to be distinct).
#   Help Sagar to find the solution.
#
#   Constraints
#   1 <= T <= 10
#   1 <= N <= 10^18
#
#   Input
#   First line contains an integer T,denoting the number of testcases, Next T line follows number N.
#
#   Output
#   Output the answer in next line, if Multiple answer are possible then print the smallest three numbers
#   in increasing order and if no solution, then print -1
#
#   SAMPLE INPUT
#   2
#   2
#   5
#
#   SAMPLE OUTPUT
#   -1
#   1 2 3
