# Little Kuldeep and contests

#######################################################################################################################
#
#   Everyone who is involved with HackerEarth in what so ever form knows who Little Kuldeep is. He's not so little,
#   but he's called that. (No one knows why!) He's pretty efficient at organizing, mentoring, managing various
#   hiring challenges, contests happening on HackerEarth all the time. But age has caught up with him, finally.
#   He's turned into little, old Kuldeep from little Kuldeep.
#   Earlier, he could've handled multiple contests like a piece of cake, but it is not possible for him now.
#   In the present scenario, he needs other people to moderate contests, because he's busy moderating some other
#   contest which is happening at the same time.
#   Given the timings of the contests happening, can you check and tell little, old Kuldeep if he would need
#   a moderator to help him out, or not?
#
#   Input format:
#   The input starts with a number, t, denoting the number of contests in a single day. On the next n lines,
#   the time at which a contest starts and finishes is given.
#
#   Output format:
#   For every case, you need to print a single line stating "Will need a moderator!" if contests are clashing,
#   or "Who needs a moderator?" if the events are NOT clashing.
#
#   Constraints:
#   1 <= N <= 100
#   Time will be given in HoursHours:MinutesMinutes format. (HH:MM)
#   The end time will (Surely!) be after the start time.
#
#   Example Input:
#   2
#   09:30-11:00
#   11:00-12:00
#
#   Example Output:
#   Who needs a moderator?
#
#   SAMPLE INPUT
#   2
#   11:00-13:30
#   13:00-13:45
#
#   SAMPLE OUTPUT
#   Will need a moderator!
