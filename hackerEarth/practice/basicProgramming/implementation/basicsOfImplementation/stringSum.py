# String Sum

#######################################################################################################################
#
#   Consider All lowercase Alphabets of the English language. Here we consider each alphabet from a to z to have
#   a certain weight. The weight of the alphabet a is considered to be 1, b to be 2, c to be 3 and so on until z
#   has a weight of 26. In short, the weight of the alphabet a is 1, and the weight of all other alphabets is the
#   weight of its previous alphabet + 1.
#
#   Now, you have been given a String S
#   consisting of lowercase English characters. You need to find the summation of weight of
#   each character in this String.
#
#   For example, Consider the String aba
#   Here, the first character a has a weight of 1, the second character b has 2 and the third character a
#   again has a weight of 1. So the summation here is equal to : 1+2+1=4
#
#   Input Format:
#   The first and only line of input contains the String S.
#
#   Output Format
#   Print the required answer on a single line
#
#   Constraints
#   1 <= |S| <= 1000
#
#   SAMPLE INPUT
#   aba
#
#   SAMPLE OUTPUT
#   4
