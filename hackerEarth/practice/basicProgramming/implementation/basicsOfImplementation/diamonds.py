#   on each floor, with 2 shapes - / or \ . According to her, a diamond was made when such a shape was created:
#
#   /

#   Given the shape of lights in all the windows, help Roman count the number of diamonds formed.
#   Note: The components of the diamond should be adjacent to each other.
#
#   Input:

#   For each testcase,
#   First line contains 2 space-separated positive integers - N and M - the no. of floors in
#   the building and the no. of windows on each floor respectively.
#   N lines follow - each line contains M space-separated characters. Every character is either or / .
#
#   Output:
#   Print a single integer - the total no. of diamonds formed.
#
#   Constraints:
#   1 <= T <= 5
#   2 <= N, M <= 1000
