# Guess the permutation

#######################################################################################################################
#
#   In this problem your goal is to guess some secret permutation A of integers from 1 to 16.
#   There are 17 tests in this problem. Test number i for 1 <= i <= 16 will have the following form:
#       the first line of the input contains string "ELEMENT" (without quotes)
#       the second line of the input of the test i contains two integers from 1 to 16 each - i and element A[i]
#       of the secret permutation
#       the only line of the output file contains one integer - A[i] too.
#   Input of the last (the 17-th test) will contain the only string "PERMUTATION" (without quotes).
#   For this test your program should output some permutation of integers from 1 to 16 -
#   your variant of the secret permutation.
#   If this permutation equals to the secret permuation A and passes all the 17 tests with your solution ,
#   you will receive 100 points. Otherwise you will receive 0 points. Note that for each wrong try
#   you will receive 20 minutes penalty time after you solved this problem (as in ACM ICPC format)
#   Let us remind you that after you submit solution you can see a detailed feedback for each test separately.
#   You can't use "compile and test" without using custom input. If you want to test your solution
#   on hackerearth platform , please use custom input.
