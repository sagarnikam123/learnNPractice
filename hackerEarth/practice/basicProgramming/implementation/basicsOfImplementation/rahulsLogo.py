# Rahul's Logo

#######################################################################################################################
#
#   Rahul has set upon the quest for a new logo of his company. He has created the following continuous logo:
#
#       /\
#      /  \
#     / /\ \
#    / /  \ \
#   / / /\ \ \
#     \ \ \/ / /
#      \ \  / /
#       \ \/ /
#        \  /
#         \/
#
#   However, his sister, Rashi, likes the following discontinuous design more
#
#      /\
#     /  \
#    / /\ \
#   / /  \ \
#     \ \  / /
#      \ \/ /
#       \  /
#        \/
#
#   The size of a logo is the longest continuous streak of same characters on an arm.
#   So, size of 1st logo is 5 while that of 2nd one is 4.
#   Now, he wants to paint both of these logos on a canvas.
#   Given an integer N, write a program that outputs these logos for sizes N and N + 1, one below the other.
#   Please note that Rahul's logo is only valid for odd sizes and Rashi's logo is only valid for even values.
#
#   Input Format:
#   Each file has just one line containing integer N.
#
#   Output Format:
#   Output the two logos, one below the other.
#
#   Constraints:
#   N  <=  100
#
#   Notes:
#   An exact checker is used, so please make sure that you strictly adhere to the output format
#   and leave no trailing spaces.
