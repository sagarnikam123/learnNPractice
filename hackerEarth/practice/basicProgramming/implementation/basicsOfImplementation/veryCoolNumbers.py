# Very Cool Numbers

#######################################################################################################################
#
#   For a number X, let its "Coolness" be defined as the number of "101"s occurring in its binary representation.
#   For example, the number 21 has Coolness 2, since its binary representation is 101012, and the string "101" occurs
#   twice in this representation.
#   A number is defined as Very Cool if its Coolness is greater than or equal to K. Please, output the number of
#   Very Cool integers between 1 and R.
#
#   Input:
#   The first line contains an integer T, the number of test cases.
#   The next T lines contains two space-separated integers, R and K.
#
#   Output:
#   Output T lines, the answer for each test case.
#
#   Constraints:
#   1 <= T <= 100
#   1 <= R <= 10^5
#   1 <= K <= 100
#
#   SAMPLE INPUT
#   1
#   5 1
#
#   SAMPLE OUTPUT
#   1
