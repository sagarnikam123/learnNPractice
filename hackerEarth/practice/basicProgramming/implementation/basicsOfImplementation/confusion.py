#
#   As you know our star "gachn" is rising star in competitive programming but now a days he is upset because of
#   a task given to him by his mentor. His teacher gave him a task : The task is that he has been given a array
#   of N integers . his teacher gave him Q queries to solve.For each query he has to tell the teacher the number
#   of distinct integers from Ai.Ai+1.Ai+2.......AN.
#   For example N=5 and Q=3.
#
#   Input
#   5 3
#
#   1 2 3 2 1
#
#   2
#
#   1
#
#   4
#
#   Output :
#   3
#
#   3
#
#   2
#
#   Constraints :
#   1<=N,Q<=100000
#   1<=A[i]<=100000
#   1<=l<=N
#
#   Input
#   First line will contain 2 integers N ,Q. next line will contain N-space separated integers.
#   next Q lines will contain an integer** L**
#
#   Output
#   For each Q lines output the no.of distinct integers.
#
#   SAMPLE INPUT
#   5 3
#   1 2 3 4 5
#   1
#   3
#   5
#
#   SAMPLE OUTPUT
