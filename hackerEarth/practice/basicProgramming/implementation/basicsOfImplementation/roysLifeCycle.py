# Roy's Life Cycle

#######################################################################################################################
#
#   Roy is going through the dark times of his life. Recently his girl friend broke up with him and to overcome the
#   pain of acute misery he decided to restrict himself to Eat-Sleep-Code life cycle. For N days he did nothing
#   but eat, sleep and code.
#   A close friend of Roy kept an eye on him for last N days. For every single minute of the day, he kept track
#   of Roy's actions and prepared a log file.
#
#   The log file contains exactly N lines, each line contains a string of length 1440 ( i.e. number of minutes
#   in 24 hours of the day).
#   The string is made of characters E, S, and C only; representing Eat, Sleep and Code respectively.
#   ith character of the string represents what Roy was doing during ith minute of the day.
#
#   Roy's friend is now interested in finding out the maximum of longest coding streak of the day - X.
#   He also wants to find the longest coding streak of N days - Y.
#   Coding streak means number of C's without any E or S in between.
#   See sample test case for clarification.
#
#   Input:
#   First line of each file contains N - number of days.
#   Following N lines contains a string of exactly 1440 length representing his activity on that day.
#
#   Output:
#   Print X and Y separated by a space in a single line.
#
#   Constraints:
#   1 ≤ N ≤ 365
#   String consists of characters E, S, and C only.
#   String length is exactly 1440.
#   Note: The sample test case does not follow the given constraints on string length to avoid large data.
#   It is meant only for explanation. We assure you that the hidden test files strictly follow the constraints.
#
#   SAMPLE INPUT
#   4
#   SSSSEEEECCCCEECCCC
#   CCCCCSSSSEEECCCCSS
#   SSSSSEEESSCCCCCCCS
#   EESSSSCCCCCCSSEEEE
#
#   SAMPLE OUTPUT
#   7 9
#
#   Explanation
#   Longest coding streak for each day is as follows:
#   Day 1: 4
#   Day 2: 5
#   Day 3: 7
#   Day 4: 6
#   Maximum of these is 7, hence X is 7.
#   Now in order to find longest coding streak of the all days, we should also check if Roy continued his coding
#   from previous days.
#   As in the sample test case, Roy was coding for 4 minutes at the end of Day 1 and he continued to code till 5
#   more minutes on Day 2. Hence the longest coding streak is 4+5 equals 9. There is no any other coding streak
#   larger than this. So the longest coding streak of all days is 9.
