# Roy and Texting Robot

#######################################################################################################################
#
#   Roy frequently needs to use his old Nokia cell phone for texting whose keypad looks exactly as shown below.
#   (image)
#   You may be already familiar with the working of the keypad, however if you're not we shall see a few examples.
#   To type "b", we need to press "2" twice. To type "?" we need to press "1" thrice. To type "5" we need
#   to press "5" four times. To type "0" we need to press "0" twice.
#   I hope that it's clear how the keypad is being used.
#   Now Roy has lot of text messages and they are pretty lengthy. So he devised a mechanical-hand-robot
#   (with only 1 finger) which does the typing job. One drawback of this robot is its typing speed.
#   It takes 1 second for single press of any button. Also it takes 1 second to move from one key to another.
#   Initial position of the hand-robot is at key 1.
#
#   So if its supposed to type "hack" it will take 1 second to move from key 1 to key 4
#   and then 2 seconds to type "h".
#   Now again 1 second to move from key 4 to key 2 and then 1 second to type "a".
#   Since "c" is present at the same key as "a" movement time is 0. So it simply takes 3 seconds to type "c".
#   Finally it moves from key 2 to key 5 in 1 second and then 2 seconds to type "k".
#   So in total it took 1+2+1+1+3+1+2= 11 seconds to type "hack".
#
#   Input:
#   First line contains T - number of test cases.
#   Each of next T lines contain a string S - the message Roy needs to send.
#   Each string is terminated by a newline escape sequence \n.
#
#   Output:
#   For each test case output the time taken by the hand-robot to type down the message.
#
#   Constraints:
#   1  <=  T  <=  50
#   1  <=  |S|  <=  1000 , where |S| denotes the length of string S
#   String is made of all the characters shown in the image above which are as follows:
#   "." (period), "," (comma), "?" (question mark), "!" (exclamation mark),
#   [a-z] (small case english alphabets), "_" (underscore) and [0-9] (digits)
#   Note: We are using "_" underscore instead of " " empty space to avoid confusion
#
#   SAMPLE INPUT
#   3
#   hack
#   5!
#   i_?_u
#
#   SAMPLE OUTPUT
#   11
#   10
#   15
