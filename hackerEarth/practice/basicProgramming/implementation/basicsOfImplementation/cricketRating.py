#   India is a cricket crazy nation. Chang also loves cricket and computations related to cricket. Chang has created
#   a Cricket app.This app analyses the performance of a cricketer. If a cricketer under-performs, then a negative
#   rating is awarded. If performance is good, then positive rating is awarded to the cricketer.Chang wants
#   to analyse the performance of a cricketer over a period of N matches. Chang wants to find consistency of a
#   cricketer. So he wants to find out the maximum consistent sum of cricket rating of a batsman or a bowler
#   only if his overall rating is positive over that period. Help chang in doing so.
#
#   Input
#   The first line contain number of matches "N" over which the analysis is to be done. The second line contains
#   those ratings of a batsman/bowler in those N matches.
#
#   Output
#   Print a single integer ie. the maximum consistent sum of rating of the cricketer if it is positive
#   otherwise output 0 (zero).
#
#   Constraint
#   0 <= N(matches) <= 10^5
#   −100 <= rating <= +100
#
#   SAMPLE INPUT
#   8
#   -1 -4  4 -2 0 1 4 -5
#
#   SAMPLE OUTPUT
#   7
