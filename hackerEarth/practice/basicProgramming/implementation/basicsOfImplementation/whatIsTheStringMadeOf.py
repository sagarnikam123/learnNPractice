# What is the string made of?

#######################################################################################################################
#
#   You are given a string, which contains entirely of decimal digits (0-9). Each digit is made of a certain number
#   of dashes, as shown in the image below. For instance 1 is made of 2 dashes, 8 is made of 7 dashes and so on.
#   (image - digits made of dashes)
#   You have to write a function that takes this string message as an input and returns a corresponding value in
#   terms of a number. This number is the count of dashes in the string message.
#
#   Note:
#   0 consists of 6 dashes, 1 consists of 2 dashes, 2 consists of 5 dashes, 3 consists of 5 dashes,
#   4 consists of 4 dashes, 5 consists of 5 dashes, 6 consists of 6 dashes, 7 consists of 3 dashes
#   [though the figure shows that 7 consists of 4 dashes but due to minor mistake in the problem please
#   write your solution assuming 7 consists of 3 dashes], 8 consists of 7 dashes, 9 consists of 6 dashes.
#
#   Constraints
#       String message will contain at least one digit, but not more than 100
#       Each character in code will be a digit ('0'-'9').
#
#   SAMPLE INPUT
#   12134

#   SAMPLE OUTPUT
