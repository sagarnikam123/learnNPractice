# Little Jhool and his breakup

#######################################################################################################################
#
#   After minting loads of money from innocent people by using the psychic powers (As we saw in the previous
#   question!) - little Jhool managed to woo his girlfriend big Jhool! And now, he's in love - madly,
#   madly in love with his girlfriend.
#   But the road to love is not easy as they say, little Jhool and big Jhool live in two different cities,
#   and they often have to rely on multiple online clients to communicate. And many times, due to frustration,
#   little Jhool starts hitting his keyboard, pressing the wrong keys - and thus, he ends up sending her
#   a meaningless message, which frustrates his girlfriend - obviously. But big Jhool is a smart girl and
#   she knows what to reciprocate back to her boyfriend's message based on the message she has received from him.
#   She figures that if and only if, she can delete several characters from the message sent by her boyfriend,
#   resulting in the word "love", it will be considered that she managed to understand his message,
#   and if not... well, some trouble is waiting for her boyfriend!
#
#   Input format:
#   There's only one line in the input, it contains the message sent by her boyfriend.
#
#   Output format:
#   If she managed to understand his message, print "I love you, too!" - else, print "Let us breakup!"
#
#   Constraints:
#   1 <= Length of message <= 100
#
#   Example:
#   Let's say that the message sent by him is: ahhellolvloe, the answer would be "I love you, too!" since
#   it is possible that by deleting characters, she gets the word love.
#   Let's say that the message sent by him is: lvoe, the answer would be, "Let us breakup!"
#   because there's no way you could get the word love by only using the delete operation.
#   PS: You can only perform deletion, on the message sent - you cannot rearrange the words in the message!
#
