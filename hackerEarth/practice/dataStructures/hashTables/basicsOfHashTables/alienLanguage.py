# Alien language

#
#   Little Jhool considers Jaadu to be a very close friend of his. But, he ends up having some misunderstanding with
#   him a lot of times, because Jaadu's English isn't perfect, and Little Jhool sucks at the language Jaadu speaks.
#   So, he's in a fix - since he knows that Jaadu has got magical powers, he asks him to help so as to clear all the
#   issues they end up having with their friendship.
#   Now, Jaadu can only focus at one task, so to fix these language issues he comes up with a magical way out,
#   but someone needs to do the rest of it; this is where Little Jhool has asked for your help.
#   Little Jhool says a word, and then Jaadu says another word. If any sub-string of the word said by Jaadu is a
#   sub-string of the word said by Little Jhool, the output should be "YES", else "NO". (Without the quotes.)
#
#   Input:
#   First line contains number of test case T. Each test case contains two strings *Text ( Said by Jhool ) * and
#   Pattern (Said by Jaadu ).Both strings contains only lowercase alphabets ['a'-'z'].
#
#   Output:
#   For each test case print YES if any sub-string of Pattern is sub-string of Text else print NO.
#
#   Constraints:
#   1<=T<=5
#   1<=|Text|<=100000
#   1<=|Pattern|<=100000
#
#   SAMPLE INPUT
#   2
#   hackerearth
#   hacker
#   hackerearth
#   wow
#
#
#   SAMPLE OUTPUT
#   YES
#   NO
