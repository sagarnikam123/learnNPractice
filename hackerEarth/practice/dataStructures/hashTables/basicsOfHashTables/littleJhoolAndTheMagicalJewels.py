# Little Jhool and the Magical Jewels

#######################################################################################################################
#
#   Little Jhool is still out of his mind - exploring all his happy childhood memories. And one of his favorite
#   memory is when he found a magical ghost, who promised to fulfill one of Little Jhool's wish.
#   Now, Little Jhool was a kid back then, and so he failed to understand what all could he have asked for from
#   the ghost. So, he ends up asking him something very simple. (He had the intuition that he'd grow up to be a
#   great Mathematician, and a Ruby programmer, alas!) He asked the ghost the power to join a set
#   of *the letters r, u, b and y * into a real ruby. And the ghost, though surprised, granted Little Jhool his wish...
#   Though he regrets asking for such a lame wish now, but he can still generate a lot of real jewels when he's
#   given a string. You just need to tell him, given a string, how many rubies can he generate from it?
#
#   Input Format:
#   The first line contains a number t - denoting the number of test cases. The next line contains a string.
#
#   Output Format:
#   Print the maximum number of ruby(ies) he can generate from the given string.
#
#   Constraints:
#   1 ≤ t ≤ 100
#   1 ≤ Length of the string ≤ 100
