# BOB -An Idiot!!

#######################################################################################################################
#
#   Andi and Bob were friends since childhood days. But, as they grew up Bob started behaving weird and this used
#   to irritate Andi. Once, while Andi took a break after typing a large program Bob came from nowhere and swapped
#   some alphabet keys on Andi's keyboard.
#   Andi got very angry on seeing this and decided to end their friendship once forever. As we all know Bob is very
#   good at heart and never does anything wrong intentionally. He decided to type the remaining program with the
#   same keyboard Configuration. Given the original fragment of the code that Bob needs to type, You need to tell
#   Bob the code that he should type to get the original code as output.
#   Help him saving his friendship with Andi.
#
#   INPUT :
#   First line of the input contains a single integer N denoting the number of swaps done by Bob. Next N lines
#   contain a pair of characters A,B denoting the characters which are swapped by Bob (Note that Bob performs
#   these swaps in the given order). From the very next line of input the remaining fragment of the code starts
#   and ends with an end of file character.
#
#   OUTPUT:
#   print the fragment of the program that Bob types.
#
#   CONSTRAINTS:
#   1 <= N <= 106
#   1 <= |length of codefragment| <= 106
#   code fragment contains uppercase and lowercase english alphabets only and space.
#   A,B belongs to Alphabet set (both upper case and lower case letters are included).
#
#   SAMPLE INPUT
