#
#   Everyone knows that some special Pikachus hate evolving into Raichus. (The legend says because Raichu is ugly,
#   and Pikachu looks good!) The question is how do we find these special Pikachus who hate evolution? The crazy
#   Poke'mon trainer Ash Catch'Em has derived a random algorithm, which is completely wrong, but since he's your
#   friend, you've to humor him and his crazy algorithms.
#   He thinks if you are given N Pikachus in an array, A1,A2 ... AN, where each Pikachu is denoted by an integer.
#   The total number of unique pairs (Ai,Aj) where i < j is the number of Pikachus who hate evolution.
#
#   Input format:
#   The first line will consist of a single integer N. The second line consists of N integers A1,A2 ... AN.
#
#   Output format:
#   Output the total number of unique pairs (Ai,Aj) that can be formed,
#   which will also be the number of special Pikachus.
#
#   Constraints:
#   1 ≤ N
#   ≤ 2 * 105
#   1 ≤ A
#
#   i ≤ 109
#
#   Reference:
#
#   SAMPLE INPUT
#   5
#   1 2 2 1 3
#
#   SAMPLE OUTPUT
#   6
#
#   Explanation
#   All the possible pairs are (1,1),(1,2) , (1,3) , (2,1), (2,2), (2,3).
