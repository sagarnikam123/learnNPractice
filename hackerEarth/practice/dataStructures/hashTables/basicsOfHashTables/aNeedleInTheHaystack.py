# A Needle in the Haystack

#   Our hacker, Little Stuart lately has been fascinated by ancient puzzles. One day going through some really old
#   books he finds something scribbled on the corner of a page. Now Little Stuart believes that the scribbled text
#   is more mysterious than it originally looks, so he decides to find every occurrence of all the permutations of
#   the scribbled text in the entire book. Since this is a huge task, Little Stuart needs your help, he needs you
#   to only figure out if any permutation of the scribbled text exists in the given text string, so he can save
#   time and analyze only those text strings where a valid permutation is present.
#
#   Input:
#   First line contains number of test cases T.Each test case contains two lines ,first line contains pattern and
#   next line contains a text string. All characters in both the strings are in lowercase only [a-z].
#
#   Output:
#   For each test case print "YES" or "NO" (quotes for clarity) depending on whether any permutation of the
#   pattern exists in the text string.
#
#   Constraints:
#   1 ≤ T ≤ 100
#   1 ≤ |Pattern| ≤ 1000
#   1 ≤ |Text String| ≤ 100000
