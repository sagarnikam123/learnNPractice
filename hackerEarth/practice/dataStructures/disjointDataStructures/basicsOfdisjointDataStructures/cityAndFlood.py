#   Fatland is a town that started with N distinct empires, namely empires 1, 2, ..., N. But over time, the armies
#   of some of these empires have taken over other ones. Each takeover occurred when the army of empire i invaded
#   empire j. After each invasion, all of empire j became part of empire i, and empire j was renamed as empire i.
#   Empire Huang, leader of Badland, wants to invade Fatland. To do this, he needs to calculate how many distinct
#   empires still remain in Fatland after all the takeovers. Help him with this task.
#
#   Input:
#   The first line contains an integer N, the number of empires that were originally in Fatland.
#   The second line contains an integer K, denoting the number of takeovers that took place.
#   Each of the next K lines contains 2 space-separated integers i, j, representing that the army of empire i took
#   over that of empire j. As a result, empire j does not exist anymore and is now renamed as empire i.
#   It is guaranteed that empire i still exists.
#
#   Output: Output one integer, the number of empires that exist in Fatland.
#
#   Constraints:
#   1 <= N <= 10^5
#   1 <= K <= 10^5
#
#   SAMPLE INPUT
#   4
#   2
#   1 2
#   4 1
#
#   SAMPLE OUTPUT
#   2
#
#   Explanation
#   Fatland started with empires 1, 2, 3, 4. First, empire 1 invaded empire 2, so empire 2 was renamed to empire 1.
#   Then, empire 4 invaded empire 1. So what were at the beginning empires 1 and 2 were renamed to empire 4. Now,
#   only empires 3 and 4 remain, so the answer is 2.
