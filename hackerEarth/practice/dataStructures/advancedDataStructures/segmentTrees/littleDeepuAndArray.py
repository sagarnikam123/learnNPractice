# Little Deepu and Array

#######################################################################################################################
#
#   Little Deepu loves positive things in life, positive girlfriends, positive marks. He's, in general a lover of
#   positive things, so for obvious reasons he loves an array which contains positive elements.
#   Anyway, Little Deepu also thinks that not every value in his so called positive array deserves to be valued
#   so high, so he makes an operation called HIT which takes exactly one argument, i.e., HIT (X). When HIT (X) is
#   called, it decreases the value of all the elements of the array by 1 which are greater than X.
#   Now, to test how positive can you stay in life, he performs M HIT operations, and after they have been done,
#   Deepu wants you to print the final array.
#
#   Input:
#   First line contains N the size of array. Second lines contains N elements of array. Third line contains an
#   integer M next M lines contains a single integer X.
#
#   Output:
#   Print final array after M HIT operations.
#
#   Constraints:
#   1 <= N <= 100000
#   1 <= A[i] <= 1000000000
#   1 <= M <= 20000
#   1 <= X <= 1000000000
#
#   SAMPLE INPUT
#   5
#   7 8 3 2 10
#   4
#   1
#   3
#   5
#   7
#
#   SAMPLE OUTPUT
#   5 5 2 1 7
