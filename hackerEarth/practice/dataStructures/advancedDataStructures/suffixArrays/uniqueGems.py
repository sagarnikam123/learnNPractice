# Unique Gems

#######################################################################################################################
#
#   Rahul has entered into a mysterious land of gems. There is a record S for each of the gems that is maintained
#   in form of a string. Each gem is characterized by some substring of this string. Interestingly, the number of
#   occurrences of a sub-string in S is the exact number of such gems present in the land.
#   However, Rahul is only interested in unique gems.
#   Please tell the number of such sub-strings that occur exactly once.
#
#   Input Format:
#   The first line of input file contains an integer T, denoting the number of test cases.
#   Each of the following T lines contain a string.
#
#   Output Format:
#   The output file should contain exactly T numbers, each representing output to corresponding test case.
#
#   Constraints:
#   1  <=  T  <=  10
#   1  <=  |S|  <=  10^5
#   Each of the characters in string S lie between a-z.
#
#   Sample Explanation:
#   Case #1:
#   aaa is the only substring that occurs once.
#   Case #2:
#   b, ab, ba, aba are the unique substrings.
#   Case #3:
#   aba, bab, ba, and abab are unique substrings.
#
#   SAMPLE INPUT
#   3
#   aaa
#   aba
#   abab
#
#   SAMPLE OUTPUT
#   1
#   4
