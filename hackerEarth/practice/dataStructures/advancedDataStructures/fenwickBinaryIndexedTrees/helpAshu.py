#   Ashu and Shanu are best buddies. One day Shanu gives Ashu a problem to test his intelligence.He gives him
#   an array of N natural numbers and asks him to solve the following queries:-
#   Query 0:- modify the element present at index i to x.
#   Query 1:- count the number of even numbers in range l to r inclusive.
#   Query 2:- count the number of odd numbers in range l to r inclusive.
#
#   input:
#   First line of the input contains the number N. Next line contains N natural numbers.
#   Next line contains an integer Q followed by Q queries.
#   0 x y - modify the number at index x to y.
#   1 x y - count the number of even numbers in range l to r inclusive.
#   2 x y - count the number of odd numbers in range l to r inclusive.
#
#   Constraints:
#   1 <= N,Q <= 10^5
#   1 <= l <= r <= N
#   0 <= Ai <= 10^9
#   1 <= x <= N
#   0 <= y <= 10^9
#   Note:- indexing starts from 1.
