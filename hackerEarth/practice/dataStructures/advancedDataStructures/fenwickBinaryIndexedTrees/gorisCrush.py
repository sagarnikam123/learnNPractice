# Gori's Crush

#######################################################################################################################
#
#   Our web developer Gori is having this huge crush on a girl of his batch. But he is very afraid of proposing her.
#   He does not know whether to do it or not. He told this to his best friend Micro, who is an astrologer.
#   Micro came up with an idea to help Gori. He is having a list of N fortune numbers. He asked Gori two numbers,
#   say a & b (a<=b). He also asked two numbers from Gori's crush, say c & d (c<=d) (The numbers a, b, c & d do not
#   necessarily belong to the list). Then he made two lists from fortune numbers. One having fortune numbers which
#   lie between a & b (inclusive) and one having fortune numbers which lie between c & d (inclusive). Then he
#   counted the number of same elements in the two lists and called it the Matching factor, say m. Micro has a
#   special number say k, now if m >= k, then Gori should propose his crush, otherwise not.
#   But Gori was not satisified with just one result. So they followed above procedure several times for different
#   values of a, b , c & d and Micro also kept updating the list of fortune numbers. This became a hectic task.
#   So they asked you to make a program for it.
#
#   Input:
#   The first line consists of three space separated integers N, Q and k.
#   Second line consists of N space separated integers, the initial list of fortune numbers.
#   The following Q lines contain Q queries. There are two types of queries:
#   i) 0 x y, replace xth element in the list by y.
#   ii) 1 a b c d, print answer for given value of a, b, c, d
#
#   Output:
#   For each query of type 1, print "Propose" (without quotes) in a new line if for given a, b, c & d value of
#   matching factor, m â‰¥ k, otherwise print "Do not propose" (without quotes) in a new line.
#
#   Constraints:
#   1  <=  N, Q, k  <=  10^5
#   1  <=  Fortune Numbers  <=  10^9
#   1  <=  x  <=  N
#   1  <=  a, b, c, d, y  <=  10^9
#
#   SAMPLE INPUT
#   5 3 3
#   1 2 3 4 5
#   1 2 3 3 7
#   0 5 6
#   1 1 6 3 7
#
#   SAMPLE OUTPUT
#   Do not propose
#   Propose
#
#   Explanation
#   For first query the lists are (2,3) and (3,4,5). Common element is 3 only. So matching factor = 1 which is
#   less than given k. So answer is Do not propose.
#   Second query updates list to 1 2 3 4 6.
#   For third query the lists are (1,2,3,4,6) and (3,4,6). Common elements are 3, 4 & 6. So matching factor = 3
#   which is equal to given k. So answer is Propose.
