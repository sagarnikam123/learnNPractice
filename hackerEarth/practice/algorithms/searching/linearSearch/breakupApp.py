# Breakup App

#######################################################################################################################
#
#   Bosky and Menot are two friends who participated in GSF Hacks Prelims on HackerEarth, and both of them easily
#   qualified for the on-site round. Bosky wants to team up with Menot for the on-site round but Menot has a date
#   with his girlfriend the same day. Bosky thus plans to spoil Menot’s date and trigger their breakup.
#   Menot and his girlfriend both use a chat application developed by Bosky. Bosky can read all the messages sent
#   using his app, so he first wants to know whether they have postponed or preponed their date or not.
#   To confirm the same Bosky has decided to search for all the days they have discussed about in past week and
#   see which of the day is decided for the date. GSF Hacks is on 19th and 20th, if they are going on a date on
#   some other day Bosky can attend GSF Hacks with his friend, otherwise he will have to come up with some other
#   idea. Bosky knows that when his friend and his [friend’s] girlfriend have to choose a day, the girlfriend's
#   choice is given twice more weightage than Menot's.
#   The problem is that Menot and his girlfriend talk a lot (-_-) and have a very long chat history which Bosky
#   cannot read manually to know about their date. Bosky asks you to help him write a program that can do the same.
#   He provides you with the chat history in following format.
#
#   [G/M]*: <message>
#    G: I want to go on 19
#    M: No that is not possible lets go on 21
#    G: No 19 is final and 21 is not
#    M: OKAY as you wish
#
#   *[G means that it is Girlfriend’s message and M means that it is Menot’s message]
#
#   In the above chat history we can see that 19 have been discussed twice and 21 has also been discussed twice.
#   But 19 have weightage 4 and 21 has weightage 3. Disregard human logic, "21 is not" will still add 21 to the
#   weightage -- you do not need to implement NLP. Bosky thus knows that 19 has been finalised.
#   Note: If multiple days have same MAXIMUM weightage the date is cancelled.
#
#   Input:
#   First line contains an integer N and then N lines follow with a message S in the following format in each line.
#   [G/M]:
#   eg. G: Hi
#   [G means that it is Girlfriends message and M means that it is Menot’s message]
#   Note: Everything is space separated and the days will be integers with
#   no leading zeroes and will always be preceded by a space]
#
#   Output : Print “Date” if the decided day is 19 or 20 otherwise print “No Date”.
#   Note: If multiple days have same weightage the date is cancelled and you must output “No Date”
#
#   Constrains
#   1 <= N <= 1000
#   2 <= |S| <= 1000 [ Length of each message ]
#   1 <= Day <= 30 [ Days discussed in the chat ]
#
#   SAMPLE INPUT
#   4
#   G: I want to go on 19
#   M: No that is not possible lets go on 21
#   G: No 19 is final and 21 is not
#   M: OKAY as you wish
#
#   SAMPLE OUTPUT
#   Date
#
#   Explanation
#   19 have been discussed twice and 21 has also been discussed twice. But 19 have weightage 4 and 21 has weightage 3.
#   Hence 19 is decided and "Date" is printed
