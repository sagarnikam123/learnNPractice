#
#   The grandest stage of all, Wrestlemania XXX recently happened. And with it, happened one of the biggest
#   heartbreaks for the WWE fans around the world. The Undertaker's undefeated streak was finally over.
#   Now as an Undertaker fan, you're disappointed, disheartened and shattered to pieces. And Little Jhool doesn't
#   want to upset you in any way possible. (After all you are his only friend, true friend!) Little Jhool knows
#   that you're still sensitive to the loss, so he decides to help you out.
#   Every time you come across a number, Little Jhool carefully manipulates it. He doesn't want you to face
#   numbers which have "21" as a part of them. Or, in the worst case possible, are divisible by 21.
#   If you end up facing such a number you feel sad... and no one wants that - because you start chanting
#   "The streak is broken!" , if the number doesn't make you feel sad, you say,
#   "The streak lives still in our heart!". Help Little Jhool so that he can help you!
#
