#######################################################################################################################
#
#   Manna is extremely disappointed to find out that no one in his college knows his first name. Even his classmates
#   call him only by his last name. Frustrated, he decides to make his fellow college students know his first
#   name by forcing them to solve this question.
#   You are given a long string as input in each testcase, containing any ASCII character. Your task is to
#   find out the number of times SUVO and SUVOJIT appears in it.
#   Note: This problem must be solved in C language only.
#
#   Input Format
#   The first line contains the number of testcases, T. Next, T lines follow each containing a long string S.
#
#   Output Format
#   For each long string S, display the no. of times SUVO and SUVOJIT appears in it.
#
#   Constraints
#   1 <= T <= 100
#   1 <= Length of each string <= 150
#
#   SAMPLE INPUT
#   3
#   SUVOJITSU
#   651SUVOMN
#   $$$$$SUVOSUVOJIT$$$$$
#
#   SAMPLE OUTPUT
#   SUVO = 0, SUVOJIT = 1
#   SUVO = 1, SUVOJIT = 0
#   SUVO = 1, SUVOJIT = 1
