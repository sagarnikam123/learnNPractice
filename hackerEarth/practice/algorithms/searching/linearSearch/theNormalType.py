# The Normal Type

#######################################################################################################################
#
#   There are a lot of Poke'mons who are jealous of the fact that they do NOT have any specialty,
#   they're the... normal type of Poke'mon. But, what they fail to realize is that their power is their normalcy,
#   the ability to think, rationalize and then act.
#   But, they do have an additional power... Poke'mons like Jigglypuff - which are normal, can figure out if a
#   trainer is real or is a part of Team Rocket. And they need to use their power to a great extent.
#   In an array, which consists of N elements, A1, A2, ..., AN, if a subarray has the total number of distinct
#   elements as that of the original array, that determines the presence of Team Rocket.
#   You've to help the normal type Poke'mons in figuring out the total number of subarrays having total number of
#   distinct elements same as that of the original array.
#
#   Input format:
#   The first line of the input will consist of a single integer N.
#   The next line will consist of N integers A1, A2, ... , AN.
#
#   Output format: Output the answer to the problem.
#
#   Constraints:
#   1 <= N <= 2 * 10^5
#   1 <= A i <= 10^9
#

#   SAMPLE INPUT
#   5
#   1 2 2 1 1
#
#   SAMPLE OUTPUT
#   8
#
#   Explanation
#   All the possible subarrays are [1,2] , [1,3] , [1,4] , [1,5] , [2,4] , [2,5] , [3,4] , [3,5]
