# Mehta And Subarrays

#######################################################################################################################
#
#   This time your task is simple.
#
#   Task:
#   Mehta has to find the longest subarray whose sum is greater than equal to zero in a given array of length** N**.
#   After he finds out the length of longest subarray, he has to report how many subarrays of such maximum length
#   exist that satisfy the mentioned property.
#
#   Note:
#   Subarray is defined as an array of contiguous numbers in a particular array. Subarray(A,B) has length (B-A+1)
#   and consists of all numbers from index A to index B.
#
#   Input:
#   First Line of the input consists of a single integer N as described above.
#   Next Line consists of N space separated integers.
#
#   Output:
#   In a single line, output the maximum length and number of such subarrays having maximum length
#   separated by a single space.In case, there is no such subarray having sum greater than equal to zero,
#   simply print "-1" without quotes.
#
#   Constraints:
#   N <= 10^6
#   Each number in the array is less than equal to 10^9 and greater than equal to -10^9 (-10^9 <= A[i] <= 10^9)
#
#   SAMPLE INPUT
#   4
#   -1 -2 3 -1
#
#   SAMPLE OUTPUT
#   3 2
