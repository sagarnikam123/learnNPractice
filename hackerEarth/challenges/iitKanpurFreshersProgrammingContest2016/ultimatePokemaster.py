# Ultimate Pokemaster

#######################################################################################################################
#
#	As Ash started his quest of collecting all the pokemon, he came across an old sage sitting in the shade of a
#	banyan tree. He asked the old wise man about the presence of pokemon in that area. As it turned out, the old
#	sage was a pokemon master in his days and had infinite collection of pokemon with himself. Realizing his
#	opportunity, Ash asked the old wise sage to help him in his quest. Much to Ash’s joy, he agreed, but on a
#	condition. Ash had to answer one question. He was ready to give him n pokemon of k different types. The question
#	he asked Ash was, ‘How many different ways are there for Ash to select his n pokemon given the condition that he
#	had to have all k different types of pokemon?’ Help Ash in solving the puzzle.
#
#	Input
#
#	The first line of input contains a number T <= 100 that indicates the number of test cases to follow.
#	Each test case consists of one line containing n and k, where n is the number of pokemon Ash selects and
#	k is the number of different types of pokemon.
#
#	Output
#
#	For each test case print one line containing the number of possibilities that Ash would have had.
#	If the answer is too large, print it modulo 1000000007.
#
#	Constraints
#
#	1<=k<=n<=100000
