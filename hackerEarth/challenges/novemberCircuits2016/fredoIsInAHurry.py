# Fredo is in a Hurry

#######################################################################################################################
#
#   Fredo lives in a building with N+1 floors and his apartment is at floor N. The floors are numbered from 0 to N,
#   N being the highest floor. Fredo has just come from school and is at floor 0. His favourite anime is about
#   to start and he wants to reach his apartment as soon as possible.
#   He can either use staircase or elevator or a combination of both (use staircase for x
#
#   floors and cover rest floors by elevator) to reach his apartment.
#       If he uses staircase, he takes f amount of time to reach floor f from floor fâˆ’1.
#       Elevator takes 1 unit time to go from any floor to it's neighbouring floors.
#   The elevator currently is coming down from floor N.The elevator stops at the floor where the elevator button
#   is pressed .From this floor, the elevator goes to floor N .
#   Tell him what is the minimum time he needs to reach floor N from floor 0.
#
#   Assumptions: Only Fredo uses the elevator during that period of time. Fredo will press the elevator button
#   atmost once. If Fredo presses the elevator button at floor x, then the elevator needs to be at a floor >= x.
#
#   Input Format:
#   The first line consists of an integer T denoting the number of test cases.
#   The only line of each test consists of an integer N denoting the number of floors.
#
#   Output Format:
#   For each test case, print the minimum time Fredo needs to reach floor N
#   from floor 0 in a separate line.
#
#   Input Constraints:
#   1 <= T <= 1000
#   1 <= N <= 109
#
#   SAMPLE INPUT
#   3
#   2
#   6
#   9
#
#   SAMPLE OUTPUT
#   2
#   8
#   12
#
#   Explanation
#   Test case 1:
#   N=2
#   Fredo reaches 1st floor from floor 0 in 1 unit time. At this time, he presses the elevator button and the
#   elevator stops there as it was also at that floor (because the elevator had started coming downwards the
#   moment Fredo started to take the staircase, so in 1 unit of time, Fredo and elevator both reach floor 1).
#   Then , he uses elevator to go to the second floor from 1st floor which also takes 1 unit of time.
#   So, answer= 1 + 1
#
#   Test case 2:
#   N = 6
#   Fredo reaches floor 2 at time = 3 (because he takes 1 unit of time for 1st floor and 2 units of time
#   for 2nd floor when using staircase).
#   Elevator also reaches floor 2 at time 4. (Fredo waits for 1 unit of time at floor 2).
#   Then elevator reaches floor 6 from floor 2 in 4 units of time.
#   Fredo takes the elevator from this floor. So , total time = 4 + 4 =8
