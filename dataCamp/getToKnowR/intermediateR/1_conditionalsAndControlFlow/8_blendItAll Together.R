# Blend it all together

#	With the knowledge and skills you acquired throughout the past exercise, you'll be able to solve pretty cool	#
#	problems. To tackle this challenge, you'll also need to know how to subset data frames.							#
#																													#
#	Instead of recording the number of LinkedIn profile views only for yourself, suppose you conducted a survey 	#
#	inside the company you're working for. You've asked every employee with a LinkedIn profile how often their 		#
#	LinkedIn profile was visited in the past seven days, and stored the results in a data frame, called li_df.		#
#	This data frame is available in the workspace.																	#
#																													#
#	Analyze the data for the second day																				#
#																													#
#	Find the number of employees that are either very popular (more than 25 profile views) or rather unnoticeable	#
#	(views are below 5) on the second day, i.e. column day2 of the data frame li_df.								#
#	Simply print this number to the console.																		#
