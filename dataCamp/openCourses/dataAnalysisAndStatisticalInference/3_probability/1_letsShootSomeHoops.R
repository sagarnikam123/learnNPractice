#	Welcome to the second lab! In this lab, you'll learn all about probability, dependent and independent events, 
#	and simulating event sequences in R.
#	
#	Throughout this lab, we'll investigate the much debated phenomenon of hot hands. When a basketball player makes
#	several baskets in succession, they are describe as having a "hot hand". Fans and players have long believed in 
#	this phenomenon, which refutes the assumption that each shot is independent of the next. However,
#	a 1985 paper by Gilovich, Vallone, and Tversky found evidence that contradicted this belief and showed 
#	that successive shots are independent events.
#	
#	We do not expect to resolve this controversy today. However, in this lab we'll apply one approach to answering
#	questions like this. The goals for this lab are to (1) think about the effects of independent 
#	and dependent events, (2) learn how to simulate shooting streaks in R, and (3) to compare a simulation to 
#	actual data in order to determine if the hot hand phenomenon appears to be real.
