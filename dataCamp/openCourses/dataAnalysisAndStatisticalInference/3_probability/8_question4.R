# Question 4

#######################################################################################################################
#
#	We've shown that Kobe had some long shooting streaks, but are they long enough to support the belief
#	that he had hot hands? What can we compare them to?
#
#	To answer these questions, let's return to the idea of independence. Two processes are independent if the outcome
#	of one process doesn't effect the outcome of the second.
#	If each shot that a player takes is an independent process, having made or missed your first shot will not affect
#	the probability that you will make or miss your second shot.
#
#	A shooter with a hot hand will have shots that are not independent of one another. Specifically, if the shooter
#	makes his first shot, the hot hand model says he will have a higher probability of making his second shot.
#	Let's suppose for a moment that the hot hand model is valid for Kobe. During his career, the percentage of time
#	Kobe makes a basket (i.e. his shooting percentage) is about 45%, or in probability notation:
#	P(shot1=H)=0.45.
#
#	If Kobe has a hot hand (not independent shots), then the probability that
#	he makes his second shot would go up given that he made the first shot:
#	P(shot2=H | shot1=H)>0.45.
#
#	Is this statement true?
