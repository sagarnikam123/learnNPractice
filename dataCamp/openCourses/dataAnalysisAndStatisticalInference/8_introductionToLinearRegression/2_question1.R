# Question 1

#######################################################################################################################
#
#	In addition to runs scored, there are seven traditionally used variables in the mlb11 data set: at_bats, hits,
#	homeruns, bat_avg (batting average), strikeouts, stolen_bases, and wins. Even though it's not necessary for this
#	lab, you can always take a refresher on the rules of baseball and a description of the statistics.
#
#	There are also three newer variables: new_onbase (on base percentage), new_slug (slugging percentage),
#	and new_obs (on-base plus slugging). For the first portion of the analysis you'll consider the seven traditional
#	variables. At the end of the lab, you'll work with the newer variables on your own.
#
#	What type of plot would you use to display the relationship between runs and one of the other numerical variables?
