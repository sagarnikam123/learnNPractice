# Question 7

#######################################################################################################################
#	
#	Point 2, nearly normal residuals: To check this condition, a normal probability plot of the residuals 
#	(the graph is shown).
#	
#	qqnorm(m1$residuals)
#	qqline(m1$residuals)
#
#	The final code statement here adds a diagonal line to the normal probability plot.
#	
#	You can also look at a histogram via hist(m1$residuals).
#	
#	Which of the following is true?
#
#######################################################################################################################

1	The residuals are extremely right skewed, hence the normal distribution of residuals condition is not met.
2	The residuals are extremely left skewed, hence the normal distribution of residuals condition is not met.
3	The residuals are perfectly symmetric, hence the normal distribution of residuals condition is met.
4	The residuals are failry symmetric, with only a slightly longer tail on the right, hence it would be appropriate
	to deem the the normal distribution of residuals condition met.

Answer - 4	The residuals are failry symmetric, with only a slightly longer tail on the right, hence it would be appropriate
	to deem the the normal distribution of residuals condition met.
