# Question 3

#######################################################################################################################
#
#	Think back to the way that you described the distribution of a single variable. Recall that you discussed
#	characteristics such as center, spread, and shape. It's also useful to be able to describe the relationship of
#	two numerical variables, such as runs and at_bats above.
#
#	Looking at the plot, which of the following best describe the relationship between these two variables?
#

1	The relationship is negative, linear, and moderately strong. One of the potential outliers is a team
	with approximately 5520 at bats.
2	The relationship is positive, linear, and moderately strong. One of the potential outliers is a team
	with approximately 5520 at bats.
3	The relationship is positive, linear, and very weak. There are no outliers.
4	The relationship is positive, linear, and very weak. One of the potential outliers is a team with
	approximately 5520 at bats.

Answer - 2	The relationship is positive, linear, and moderately strong. One of the potential outliers is a team
			with approximately 5520 at bats.
