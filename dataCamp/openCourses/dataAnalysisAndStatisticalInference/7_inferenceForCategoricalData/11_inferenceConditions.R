# Inference conditions

#	As was hinted before, Table 6 of the report provides statistics, that is, calculations made from the sample of 
#	51,927 people. What you would like though, is insight into the population parameters.
#	
#	You answer the question, "What proportion of people in your sample reported being atheists?" with a statistic; 
#	while the question "What proportion of people on earth would report being atheists" is answered with
#	an estimate of the parameter.
#	
#	The inferential tools for estimating population proportion are analogous to those used for means in the 
#	previous lab: the confidence interval and the hypothesis test.
