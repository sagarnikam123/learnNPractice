# The rise of atheism in America

#######################################################################################################################
#	
#	In August of 2012, news outlets ranging from the Washington Post to the Huffington Post ran a story about the 
#	rise of atheism in America.
#	
#	The source for the story was a poll that asked people, "Irrespective of whether you attend a place of worship 
#	or not, would you say you are a religious person, not a religious person or a convinced atheist?"
#	
#	This type of question, which asks people to classify themselves in one way or another, is common in 
#	polling and generates categorical data.
#	
#	In this lab you'll take a look at the atheism survey and explore what's at play when making inference about 
#	population proportions using categorical data.
