#	Welcome to the first in-depth lab that complements the course "Data Analysis and Statistical Inference" given by 
#	Mine Ã‡etinkaya-Rundel on Cousera.
#	
#	The Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) is an annual telephone survey of 350,000 people in the 
#	United States. As its name implies, the BRFSS is designed to identify risk factors in the adult population and 
#	report emerging health trends. For example, respondents are asked about their diet and weekly physical activity, 
#	their HIV/AIDS status, possible tobacco use, and even their level of healthcare coverage.
#	
#	We will focus on a random sample of 20,000 people from the BRFSS survey conducted in 2000.
