#
#	Hello, and welcome to the first lab of "Data Analysis and Statistical Inference". The goal of this lab is to
#	introduce  you to the statistical programming language R.
#
#	You'll be using R throughout the course both to learn the statistical concepts introduced in this course,
#	as well as to analyze real data.
#
#	When you started this lab and this was the first time you're using DataCamp,
#	you were introduced to the interface with a short tour. To get you started,
#	sample code is provided in the editor on the right. For this first exercise,
#	you just have to click "Submit Answer" and check the output in the console.
