# How do I restore an old version of a file?

##############################################################################

You previously saw how to use git checkout to undo the changes that you made
since the last commit. This command can also be used to go back even further
into a file's history and restore versions of that file from a commit.
In this way, you can think of committing as saving your work, and checking
out as loading that saved version.

The syntax for restoring an old version takes two arguments: the hash that
identifies the version you want to restore, and the name of the file.

For example, if git log shows this:

commit ab8883e8a6bfa873d44616a0f356125dbaccd9ea
Author: Author: Rep Loop <repl@datacamp.com>
Date:   Thu Oct 19 09:37:48 2017 -0400

    Adding graph to show latest quarterly results.

commit 2242bd761bbeafb9fc82e33aa5dad966adfe5409
Author: Author: Rep Loop <repl@datacamp.com>
Date:   Thu Oct 16 09:17:37 2017 -0400

    Modifying the bibliography format.

then git checkout 2242bd report.txt would replace the current version
of report.txt with the version that was committed on October 16. Notice
that this is the same syntax that you used to undo the unstaged changes,
except -- has been replaced by a hash.

Restoring a file doesn't erase any of the repository's history. Instead,
the act of restoring the file is saved as another commit, because you might
later want to undo your undoing.

One more thing: there's another feature of git log that will come in handy
here. Passing - followed by a number restricts the output to that many commits.
For example, git log -3 report.txt shows you the last three commits
involving report.txt.

The current contents of data/western.csv are shown in the terminal.
Use git log -2 to list the last two changes to that file.

git log -2 data/western.csv

Use git checkout with the first few characters of a hash to restore the
version of data/western.csv that has the commit message "Adding fresh data
for southern and western regions.".

git checkout 5be6e528 data/western.csv

Use cat data/western.csv to display the updated contents.

cat data/western.csv

Commit the restored version of data/western.csv,
and be sure to include a message.

git commit -m "restored version of western.csv" data/western.csv
