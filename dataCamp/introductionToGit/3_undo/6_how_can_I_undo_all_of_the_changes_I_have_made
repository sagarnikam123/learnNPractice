# How can I undo all of the changes I have made?

##############################################################################

So far, you have seen how to undo changes to a single file at a time using
git reset HEAD path/to/file. You will sometimes want to undo changes to many files.

One way to do this is to give git reset a directory. For example,
git reset HEAD data will unstage any files from the data directory.
Even better, if you don't provide any files or directories, it will unstage
everything. Even even better, HEAD is the default commit to unstage, so you
can simply write git reset to unstage everything.

Similarly git checkout -- data will then restore the files in the data
directory to their previous state. You can't leave the file argument
completely blank, but recall from Introduction to Shell for Data Science
that you can refer to the current directory as .. So git checkout -- .
will revert all files in the current directory.

Use git reset to remove all files from the staging area.

git reset

Use git checkout to put those files back in their previous state.
Use the directory name . to mean "all of the files in or below this
directory", and separate it from the command with --.

git checkout -- .
