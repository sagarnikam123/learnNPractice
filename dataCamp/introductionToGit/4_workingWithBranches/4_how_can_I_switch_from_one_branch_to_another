# How can I switch from one branch to another?

##############################################################################

You previously used git checkout with a commit hash to switch the repository
state to that hash. You can also use git checkout with the name of a
branch to switch to that branch.

Two notes:

When you run git branch, it puts a * beside the name of the branch
you are currently in.
Git will only let you do this if all of your changes have been committed.
You can get around this, but it is outside the scope of this course.
In this exercise, you'll also make use of git rm. This removes the file
(just like the shell command rm) then stages the removal of that file
with git add, all in one step.

##############################################################################

You are in the master branch of the dental repository.
Switch to the summary-statistics branch.

git checkout summary-statistics

Use git rm to delete report.txt.

git rm report.txt

Commit your change with `-m "Removing report" as a message.

git commit -m 'Removing report'

Use ls to check that it's gone.

ls

Switch back to the master branch.

git checkout master

Use ls to ensure that report.txt is still there.

ls
