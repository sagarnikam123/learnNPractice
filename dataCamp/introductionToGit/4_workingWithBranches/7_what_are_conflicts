# What are conflicts?

##############################################################################

Sometimes the changes in two branches will conflict with each other:
for example, bug fixes might touch the same lines of code, or analyses in
two different branches may both append new (and different) records to a
summary data file. In this case, Git relies on you to reconcile
the conflicting changes.

The file todo.txt initially contains these two lines:

A) Write report.
B) Submit report.

You create a branch called update and modify the file to be:

A) Write report.
B) Submit final version.
C) Submit expenses.

You then switch back to the master branch and delete the first line,
so that the file contains:

B) Submit report.

When you try to merge update and master, what conflicts does Git report?
You can use git diff master..update
to view the difference between the two branches.


Just line B, since it is the only one to change in both branches.
Lines A and B, since one was deleted and the other changed.
Lines B and C, since one was changed and the other deleted.
All three lines, since all were either added, deleted, or changed.

Ans --> Just line B, since it is the only one to change in both branches.
