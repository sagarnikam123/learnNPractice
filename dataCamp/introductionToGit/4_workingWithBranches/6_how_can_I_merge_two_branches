# How can I merge two branches?

##############################################################################

Branching lets you create parallel universes; merging is how you bring them 
back together. When you merge one branch (call it the source) into another 
(call it the destination), Git incorporates the changes made to the source 
branch into the destination branch. If those changes don't overlap, 
the result is a new commit in the destination branch that includes everything 
from the source branch (the next exercises describe what happens 
if there are conflicts).

To merge two branches, you run git merge source destination 
(without .. between the two branch names). Git automatically opens an editor 
so that you can write a log message for the merge; you can either keep its 
default message or fill in something more informative.

You are in the master branch of the dental repository. Merge the changes 
from the summary-statistics branch (the source) into the master branch 
(the destination) with the message "Merging summary statistics."

git merge summary-statistics master
