# Guess the type

#######################################################################################################################
#
#   To find out the type of a value or a variable that refers to that value, you can use the type() function.
#   Suppose you've defined a variable a, but you forgot the type of this variable.
#   To determine the type of a, simply execute:
#
#   type(a)
#
#   We already went ahead and created three variables: a, b and c. You can use the IPython shell on the right
#    to discover their type. Which of the following options is correct?
#
#   1 - a is of type int, b is of type str, c is of type bool
#   2 - a is of type float, b is of type bool, c is of type str
#   3 - a is of type float, b is of type str, c is of type bool
#   4 - a is of type int, b is of type bool, c is of type str
#

type(a)
type(b)
type(c)

# Answer - 3 - a is of type float, b is of type str, c is of type bool
