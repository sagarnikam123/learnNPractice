# Any comments?

#######################################################################################################################
#
#   Something that Filip didn't mention in his videos is that you can add comments to your Python scripts.
#   Comments are important to make sure that you and others can understand what your code is about.
#
#   To add comments to your Python script, you can use the # tag. These comments are not run as Python code,
#   so they will not influence your result. As an example, take the comment on the right, # Just testing division;
#   it is completely ignored during execution.

# Just testing division
print(5 / 8)

# Addition works too.
print(7 + 10)
