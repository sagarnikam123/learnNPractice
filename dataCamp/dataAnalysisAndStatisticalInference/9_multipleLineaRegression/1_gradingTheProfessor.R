# Grading the professor

#######################################################################################################################
#	
#	Many college courses conclude by giving students the opportunity to evaluate the course and the instructor 
#	anonymously. However, the use of these student evaluations as an indicator of course quality and teaching 
#	effectiveness is often criticized because these measures may reflect the influence of non-teaching related 
#	characteristics, such as the physical appearance of the instructor.
#	
#	The article titled, "Beauty in the classroom: instructors' pulchritude and putative pedagogical productivity" 
#	(Hamermesh and Parker, 2005) found that instructors who are viewed to be better looking receive higher 
#	instructional ratings.
#	
#	In this lab we will analyze the data from this study in order 
#	to learn what goes into a positive professor evaluation.
