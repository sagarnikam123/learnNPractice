# Question 2

#######################################################################################################################
#	
#	If we're interested in estimating the average living area of homes in Ames using the sample,
#	our best single guess is the sample mean: mean(samp1).
#	
#	Depending on which 50 homes you selected, your estimate could be a bit above or a bit below the true 
#	population mean of approximately 1,500 square feet. In general, though, the sample mean turns out to be a pretty 
#	good estimate of the average living area, and we were able to get it by sampling less than 3% of the population.
#	
#	Suppose we took two more samples, one of size 100 and one of size 1000. 
#	Which would you think would provide a more accurate estimate of the population mean?
