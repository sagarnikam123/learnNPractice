# Lists, why would you need them? (2)

#################################################################################################################
#																												#
#	A list in R is similar to your to-do list at work or school: the different items on that list most likely	# 
#	differ in length, characteristic, type of activity that has to do be done, â€¦								#
#																												#
#	A list in R allows you to gather a variety of objects under one name (that is, the name of the list)		#
#	in an ordered way. These objects can be matrices, vectors, data frames, even other lists, etc.				#
#	It is not even required that these objects are related to each other. Just like your to-do list :-).		#
#																												#
#	Maybe you can even say that a list is a kind of super data type ;-)											#
