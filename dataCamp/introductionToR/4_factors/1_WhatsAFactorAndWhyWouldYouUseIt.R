# What's a factor and why would you use it?

#####################################################################################################################
#																													
#	In this chapter you dive into the wonderful world of factors.													
#																													
#	The term factor refers to a statistical data type used to store categorical variables.								
#	The difference between a categorical variable and a continuous variable is that a categorical variable can	 	
#	belong to a limited number of categories. A continuous variable, on the other hand,								
#	can correspond to an infinite number of values.																	
#																													
#	It is important that R knows whether it is dealing with a continuous or a categorical variable,					
#	as the statistical models you will develop in the future treat both types differently.							
#	(You will see later why this is the case.)																		
#																													
#	A good example of a categorical variable is the variable 'Gender'.												
#	A human individual can either be "Male" or "Female", making abstraction of intersexes.							
#	So here "Male" and "Female" are, in a simplified sense, the two values of the categorical variable "Gender",	
#	and every observation can be assigned to either the value "Male" of "Female".
