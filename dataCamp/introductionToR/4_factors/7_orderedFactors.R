# Ordered factors

#################################################################################################################
#																												#
#	Since "Male" and "Female" are unordered (or nominal) factor levels, R returns a warning message,			#
#	telling you that the greater than operator is not meaningful. As seen before,								#
#	R attaches an equal value to the levels for such factors.													#
#																												#
#	But this is not always the case! Sometimes you will also deal with factors that do have a natural ordering	#
#	between its categories. If this is the case, we have to make sure that we pass this information to Râ€¦		#
#																												#
#	Let us say that you are leading a research team of five data analysts and that you want to evaluate 		#
#	their performance. To do this, you track their speed, 														#
#	evaluate each analyst as "Slow", "Fast" or "Ultra-fast", and save the results in speed_vector.				#
#																												#

# Create 'speed_vector'
