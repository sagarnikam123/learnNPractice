# Naming a vector (2)

#####################################################################################################################
#
#	If you want to become a good statistician, you have to become lazy. (If you are already lazy,
#	chances are high you are one of those exceptional, natural-born statistical talents.)
#
#	In the previous exercises you probably experienced that it is boring and frustrating to type and retype
#	information such as the days of the week. However, when you look at it from a higher perspective,
#	there is a more efficient way to do this, namely, to assign the days of the week vector to a variable!
#
#	Just like you did with your poker and roulette returns, you can also create a variable that contains the days
#	of the week. This way you can use and re-use it.

# Poker winnings from Monday to Friday
poker_vector <- c(140, -50, 20, -120, 240)

# Roulette winnings from Monday to Friday
roulette_vector <- c(-24, -50, 100, -350, 10)

# Create the variable 'days_vector'
days_vector <- c("Monday","Tuesday","Wednesday","Thursday","Friday")

#Assign the names of the day to 'roulette_vector' and 'poker_vector'
names(poker_vector) <- days_vector
names(roulette_vector) <- days_vector
