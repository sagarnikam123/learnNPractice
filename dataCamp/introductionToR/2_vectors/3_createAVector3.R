#
#	After one week in Las Vegas and still zero Ferraris in your garage, you decide that it is time
#	to start using your data analytical superpowers.
#
#	Before doing a first analysis, you decide to first collect all the winnings and losses for the last week:
#
#	For poker_vector:
#
#	    On Monday you won 140$
#	    Tuesday you lost 50$
#	    Wednesday you won 20$
#	    Thursday you lost 120$
#	    Friday you won 240$
#
#	For roulette_vector:
#
#	    On Monday you lost 24$
#	    Tuesday you lost 50$
#	    Wednesday you won 100$
#	    Thursday you lost 350$
#	    Friday you won 10$
#
#	You only played poker and roulette, since there was a delegation of mediums that occupied the craps tables.
#	To be able to use this data in R, you decide to create the variables poker_vector and roulette_vector.

# Poker winnings from Monday to Friday

# Roulette winnings from Monday to Friday
roulette_vector <-  c(-24,-50,100,-350,10)
