# Else if 2.0

#																									#
#	Don't let the previous exercises misguide you: apart from simply printing out status messages,	#
#	you can do anything you want inside if-else constructs.											#
#	You can even put in another set of conditional statements. Examine the following code chunk:	#
#																									#
#	if(number < 10) {																				#
#	  if(number < 5) {																				#
#	    result <- "extra small"																		#
#	  } else {																						#
#	    result <- "small"																			#
#	  }																								#
#	} else if (number < 100) {																		#
#	  result <- "medium"																			#
#	} else {																						#
#	  result <- "large"																				#
#	}																								#
#	print(result)																					#
#																									#
#	Have a look at the following statements:														#
#																									#
#	(1) If number is set to 6, "small" gets printed to the console.									#
#	(2) If number is set to 100, R prints out "medium".												#
#	(3) If number is set to 4, "extra small" gets printed out to the console.						#
#	(4) If number is set to 2500, R will generate an error, as result will not be defined.			#
#																									#
#	Select the option that lists all the true statements.											#
