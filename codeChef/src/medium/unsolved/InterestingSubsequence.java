/**

	An interesting subsequence

	 For two given sequences of integers, find the longest possible integer sequence which is a subsequence of 
	 both these sequences, and whose elements are integers in a (strictly) increasing order.
	
	Input
	The first number is n (1 ≤ n ≤ 5000), the length of the first sequence.
	The next n integers are elements of the first sequence.
	The next is m (1 ≤ m ≤ 5000), the length of the second sequence.
	The next m integers are elements of the second sequence.

	Output
	One number k, the length of the longest possible common subsequence that is increasing, followed 
	by exactly k space-separated integers containing any exemplary sequence of this length.
