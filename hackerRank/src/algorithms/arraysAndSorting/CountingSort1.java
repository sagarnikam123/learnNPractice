	Counting Sort 1

	Comparison Sorting
	Quicksort usually has a running time of n*log(n), but is there an algorithm that can sort even faster? In general,
	this is not possible. Most sorting algorithms are comparison sorts, i.e., they sort a list just by comparing the 
	elements with one another. A comparison sort algorithm cannot beat n log(n) (worst-case) running time, 
	since n log(n) represents the minimum number of comparisons needed to know where to place each element. 
	For more details, you can see these notes (PDF).
	
	Alternative Sorting
	However, for certain types of input, it is more efficient to use a non-comparison sorting algorithm. 
	This will make it possible to sort lists even in linear time. These challenges will cover Counting Sort, 
	a fast way to sort lists where the elements have a small number of possible values, 
	such as integers within a certain range. We will start with an easy task - counting.
	
	Challenge
	Given a list of integers, can you count and output the number of times each value appears?
	
	Hint: There is no need to sort the data, you just need to count it.
	
	Input Format
	There will be two lines of input:
	
	    n - the size of the list
	    ar - n space separated numbers that makes up the list
	
	Output Format
	Output the number of times every number from 0 to 99 (inclusive) appears in the list.
	
	Constraints
	100 <= n <= 106
	0 <= x < 100 , x âˆˆ ar

Sample Output
0 2 0 2 0 0 1 0 1 2 1 0 1 1 0 0 2 0 1 0 1 2 1 1 1 3 0 2 0 0 2 0 3 3 1 0 0 0 0 2 2 1 1 1 2 0 2 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 2 1 0 1 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 2 1 3 2 0 0 2 1 2 1 0 2 2 1 2 1 2 1 1 2 2 0 3 2 1 1 0 1 1 1 0 2 2 

Explanation
the output states that 0 appears 0 times.
1 appears 2 times.
2 appears 0 times.
and so on in the given input array.
