	Counting Sort 2

	Often, when a list is sorted, the elements being sorted are just keys to other values. For example,
	if you are sorting files by their size, the sizes need to stay connected to their respective files. 
	You cannot just	take the size numbers and output them in order, you need to output all the required file information.
	However, if you are not concerned about any other information, then you can simply sort those numbers alone.
	This makes counting sort very simple. If you already counted the values in the list, you don't need 
	to access the original list again.
	This challenge involves a simple counting sort where the elements being sorted are all that matter.
	
	Challenge
	Given an unsorted list of integers, output the integers in order.
	
	Hint: You can use your previous code that counted the items to print out the actual values in-order.
	
	Input Format
	There will be two lines of input:
	
	    n - the size of the list
	    ar - n space separated numbers that belong to the list
	
	Output Format
	Output all the numbers of the list in-order.
	
	Constraints
	1 <= n <= 1000000
	0 <= x < 100 , x âˆˆ ar

Sample Output
1 1 3 3 6 8 9 9 10 12 13 16 16 18 20 21 21 22 23 24 25 25 25 27 27 30 30 32 32 32 33 33 33 34 39 39 40 40 41 42 43 44 44 46 46 48 50 53 56 56 57 59 60 61 63 65 67 67 68 69 69 69 70 70 73 73 74 75 75 76 78 78 79 79 80 81 81 82 83 83 84 85 86 86 87 87 89 89 89 90 90 91 92 94 95 96 98 98 99 99 

Explanation
In the output you can see the numbers sorted in ascending order.
You can also see that numbers appearing multiple times are printed accordingly.
