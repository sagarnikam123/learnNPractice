	Intro to Tutorial Challenges

	About Tutorial Challenges
	Many of the challenges on HackerRank are difficult and assume that you already know the relevant algorithms very 
	well. These tutorial challenges are different. They break down algorithmic concepts into smaller challenges, 
	so that, you can learn the algorithm by solving the challenges.
	
	These challenges are intended for those who know some programming and now want to learn some algorithms. 
	You could be a student majoring in Computers, a self-taught programmer, or an experienced developer 
	who wants an active algorithms review!
	
	The first series of challenges covers sorting. The challenges are listed below:
	
	Tutorial Challenges - Sorting
	
	Insertion Sort challenges
	    Insertion Sort 1 - Inserting
	    Insertion Sort 2 - Sorting
	    Correctness and loop invariant
	    Running Time of Algorithms
	
	Quicksort challenges
	    Quicksort 1 - Partition
	    Quicksort 2 - Sorting
	    Quicksort In-place (advanced)
	    Running time of Quicksort
	
	Counting sort challenges
	    Counting Sort 1 - Counting
	    Counting Sort 2 - Simple sort
	    Counting Sort 3 - Preparing
	    Full Counting Sort (advanced)
	
	There will also be some challenges, where you'll get to apply your learnings.
	
	About the Challenges
	The challenges will describe some topic and then ask you to code a solution. As you progress through the challenges,
	you will learn some important concepts in algorithms. In each challenge, you will receive input on STDIN and you will
	need to print the correct output to STDOUT.
	
	For many challenges, helper methods (like an array) will be provided for you 
	to process the input into a useful format. You can use these methods to get started with your program, 
	or you can write your own input methods if you want. Your code just needs to print the right output to each test case.
	
	Sample Challenge
	This is a simple challenge to get things started. Given a sorted array (ar) and a number (V), 
	can you print the index location of V in the array?
	{The next section describes the input format. You can often skip it, if you are using included methods. }
	
	Input Format
	There will be three lines of input:
	    V - the value that has to be searched.
	    n - the size of the array.
	    ar - n numbers that makes up the array.
	
	Output Format
	Output the index of V in the array.
	{The next section describes the constraints and ranges of the input. 
	You should check this section to know the range of the input. }
	
	Constraints
	1<=n<=1000
	-1000 <=x <= 1000 , x âˆˆ ar
***********************************************************************************************************************
{This "sample" shows the first input test case. It is often useful to go through the sample to understand a challenge.}
Sample Input
4
6
1 4 5 7 9 12

Sample Output
1

Explanation
V = 4. The 4 is located in the 1st spot on the array, so the answer is 1.
