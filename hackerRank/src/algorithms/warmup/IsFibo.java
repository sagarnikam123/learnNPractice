	Is Fibo

	You are given an integer, N. Write a program to determine if N is an element of the Fibonacci Sequence.
	The first few elements of fibonacci sequence are 0,1,1,2,3,5,8,13.... A fibonacci sequence is one
	where every element is a sum of the previous two elements in the sequence. The first two elements are 0 and 1.
	Formally:
	
	fib0 = 0
	fib1 = 1
	fibn = fibn-1 + fibn-2 âˆ€ n > 1
	
	Input Format
	The first line contains T, number of test cases.
	T lines follows. Each line contains an integer N.
	
	Output Format
	Display IsFibo if N is a fibonacci number and IsNotFibo if it is not a fibonacci number. 
	The output for each test case should be displayed on a new line.
	
	Constraints
	1 <= T <= 105
	1 <= N <= 1010
