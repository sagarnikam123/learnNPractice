	Manasa and Stones

	Manasa is out on a hike with friends. She finds a trail of stones with numbers on them. She starts following 
	the trail and notices that two consecutive stones have a difference of either a or b. Legend has it that 
	there is a treasure trove at the end of the trail and if Manasa can guess the value of the last stone,
	the treasure would be hers. Given that the number on the first stone was 0, find all the possible values for the
	number on the last stone. Note : The numbers on the stones are in increasing order
	
	Input Format
	The first line contains an integer T i.e. the number of Test cases. T testcases follow.
	Each testcase has 3 lines. The first line contains n ( the number of stones ) The second line contains a.
	The third line contains b.
	
	Output Format
	Space separated list of numbers which are the possible values of the last stone in increasing order.
	
	Constraints
	1 ≤ T ≤ 10
	1 ≤ n, a, b ≤ 103

Explanation
All possible series for first test cases are given below.
    0,1,2
    0,1,3
    0,2,3
    0,2,4
Hence the answer 2 3 4.

Series with different number of final step for second test cases are
    0, 10, 20, 30
    0, 10, 20, 120
    0, 10, 110, 120
    0, 10, 110, 210
    0, 100, 110, 120
    0, 100, 110, 210
    0, 100, 200, 210
    0, 100, 200, 300
hence the answer 30 120 210 300
