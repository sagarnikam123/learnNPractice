	by a lowercase latin letter from 'a' to 'z'. An element can be present multiple times in a rock. 
	An element is called a 'gem-element' if it occurs at least once in each of the rocks.
	
	Given the list of rocks with their compositions, display the number of gem-elements that exist in those rocks.
	
	Input Format
	The first line consists of N, the number of rocks.Each of the next N lines contain rocks' composition.
	Each composition consists of lowercase letters of English alphabet.
	
	Output Format
	Print the number of gem-elements that are common in these rocks.
	
	Constraints
	1 ≤ N ≤ 100
	Each composition consists of only small latin letters ('a'-'z').
	1 ≤ Length of each composition ≤ 100
