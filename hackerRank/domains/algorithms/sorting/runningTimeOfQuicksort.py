# Running Time of Quicksort

#######################################################################################################################
#
#   The running time of Quicksort will depend on how balanced the partitions are. If you are unlucky and select the
#   greatest or the smallest element as the pivot, then each partition will separate only one element at a time,
#   so the running time will be similar to Insertion Sort.
#   However, Quicksort will usually pick a pivot that is mid-range, and it will partition the array into two parts.
#   Let's assume Partition is lucky and it always picks the median element as the pivot.
#   What will be the running time in such a case?
#
#   Running Time of Recursive Methods
#   Quicksort is a recursive method, so we will have to use a technique to calculate the total running time of all
#   the method calls. We can use a version of the "Recursion Tree Method" to estimate the running time
#   for a given array of N elements.
#
#   Quicksort recursion tree (diagram)
#
#   Each time partition is called on a sub-array, each element in the sub-array needs to be compared to the pivot
#   element. Since all the sub-arrays are passed to partition,
#   there will be N total operations for each level of the tree. How many levels will it take for the Quicksort
#   to finish? Since we assume it always picks the middle element, the array will be split into two equal halves
#   each time. So it will take log(N) splits until we get single elements in the sub-arrays. Since there are lon(N)
#   levels and each one involves N operations, the total running time for Quicksort will be N * log(N).
#   In real sorting, Quicksort won't always pick the exact middle element. But as long as it's regularly picking
#   elements near the median value, it will have a running time better than Insertion Sort. To make sure that
#   Quicksort works well on most inputs, the real-world implementations do not pick the same index as pivot each time.
#   They use some other technique, e.g. picking a random element. There are other techniques, as well, that can be
#   used to improve Quicksort. The Java Arrays class uses a modified version of Quicksort to sort primitives.
#   Notice that O(N x long(N)) of Quicksort is much much faster than the O(N^2) of Insertion Sort. For example,
#   for an array of one million elements, N^2 = 10^12, while N * long(N) is approximately,
#   2 * 10^7 a much more manageable number.
#
#   Challenge
#   In practice, how much faster is Quicksort (in-place) than Insertion Sort? Compare the running time of the two
#   algorithms by counting how many swaps or shifts each one takes to sort an array, and output the difference.
#   You can modify your previous sorting code to keep track of the swaps. The number of swaps required by Quicksort
#   to sort any given input have to be calculated. Keep in mind that the last element of a block is chosen as the
#   pivot, and that the array is sorted in-place as demonstrated in the explanation below.
#   Any time a number is lower than the partition, it should be "swapped", even if it doesn't actually move to a
#   different location. Also ensure that you count the swap when the pivot is moved into place. The count for
#   Insertion Sort should be the same as the previous challenge, where you just count the number of "shifts".
#
#   Note
#   Please use Lomuto Partition for this challenge.
#
#   Input Format
#   There will be two lines of input:
#       n - the size of the array
#       ar - n numbers that make up the array
#
#   Output Format
#   Output one integer D, where D = (insertion sort shifts) - (quicksort swaps)
#
#   Constraints
#   1 <= n <= 1000
#   -1000 <= x <= 1000, x E (belongs to) ar
#
#   Sample Input
#   7
#   1 3 9 8 2 7 5
#
#   Sample Output
#   1
#
#   Explanation
#   Insertion Sort will take 9 "shifts" to sort the array. Quicksort will take 8 "swaps" to sort it, as shown in
#   the diagram below. 9-8 = 1is the final output.
