# The Full Counting Sort

#######################################################################################################################
#
#   In this challenge you need to print the data that accompanies each integer in a list. In addition, if two strings
#   have the same integers, you need to print the strings in their original order. Hence, your sorting algorithm
#   should be stable, i.e. the original order should be maintained for equal elements.
#   Insertion Sort and the simple version of Quicksort were stable, but the faster in-place version of Quicksort was
#   not (since it scrambled around elements while sorting).
#   In cases where you care about the original order, it is important to use a stable sorting algorithm.
#   In this challenge, you will use counting sort to sort a list while keeping the order of the strings
#   (with the accompanying integer) preserved.
#
#   Challenge
#   In the previous challenge, you created a "helper array" that contains information about the starting position of
#   each element in a sorted array. Can you use this array to help you create a sorted array of the original list?
#   Hint: You can go through the original array to access the strings. You can then use your helper array to help
#   determine where to place those strings in the sorted array. Be careful about being one off.
#
#   Details and a Twist
#   You will be given a list that contains both integers and strings. Can you print the strings in order of their
#   accompanying integers? If the integers for two strings are equal, ensure that they are print in the order
#   they appeared in the original list.
#   The Twist - Your clients just called with an update. They don't want you to print the first half of the original
#   array. Instead, they want you to print a dash for any element from the first half.
#
#   Input Format
#   - n, the size of the list ar.
#   - n lines follow, each containing an integer x and a string s.
#
#   Output Format
#   Print the strings in their correct order.
#
#   Constraints
#   1 <= n <= 1000000
#   n is even
#   1 <= length(s) <= 10
#   0 <= x < 100, x E(belongs to) ar
#   The characters in every string in lowercase.
#
#   Sample Input
#   20
#   0 ab
#   6 cd
#   0 ef
#   6 gh
#   4 ij
#   0 ab
#   6 cd
#   0 ef
#   6 gh
#   0 ij
#   4 that
#   3 be
#   0 to
#   1 be
#   5 question
#   1 or
#   2 not
#   4 is
#   2 to
#   4 the
#
#   Sample Output
#   - - - - - to be or not to be - that is the question - - - -
#   Explanation
#   Below is the list in the correct order. The strings of each number were printed above for the second half of the
#   array. Elements from the first half of the original array were replaced with dashes.
#
#   0 ab
#   0 ef
#   0 ab
#   0 ef
#   0 ij
#   0 to
#   1 be
#   1 or
#   2 not
#   2 to
#   3 be
#   4 ij
#   4 that
#   4 is
#   4 the
#   5 question
#   6 cd
#   6 gh
#   6 cd
#   6 gh
