# Lisa's Workbook

#######################################################################################################################
#
#   Lisa just got a new math workbook. A workbook contains exercise problems, grouped into chapters.
#       There are n chapters in Lisa's workbook, numbered from 1 to n.
#       The i-th chapter has ti problems, numbered from 1 to ti.
#       Each page can hold up to k problems. There are no empty pages or unnecessary spaces, so only the last page of
#           a chapter may contain fewer than k problems.
#       Each new chapter starts on a new page, so a page will never contain problems from more than one chapter.
#       The page number indexing starts at 1.
#
#   Lisa believes a problem to be special if its index (within a chapter) is the same as the page number where it's
#   located. Given the details for Lisa's workbook, can you count its number of special problems?
#
#   Note: See the diagram in the Explanation section for more details.
#
#   Input Format
#   The first line contains two integers n and k â€” the number of chapters and the maximum number of problems per
#   page respectively. The second line contains n integers t1,t2,...tn,
#   where ti denotes the number of problems in the i-th chapter.
#
#   Constraints
#   1 <= n,k,ti <= 100
#
#   Output Format
#   Print the number of special problems in Lisa's workbook.
#
#   Sample Input
#   5 3
#   4 2 6 1 10
#
#   Sample Output
#   4
#
#   Explanation
#   The diagram below depicts Lisa's workbook with n=5 chapters and a maximum of k=3 problems per page. Special
#   problems are outlined in red, and page numbers are in yellow squares.
#   [bear_workbook.png]
#   There are 4 special problems and thus we print the number 4 on a new line.
