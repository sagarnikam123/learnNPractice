# Chocolate Feast

#######################################################################################################################
#
#   Little Bobby loves chocolate, and he frequently goes to his favorite 5 & 10 store, Penny Auntie, with n dollars
#   to buy chocolates. Each chocolate has a flat cost of c dollars, and the store has a promotion where they allow
#   you to trade in m chocolate wrappers in exchange for 1 free piece of chocolate.
#   For example, if m=2 and Bobby has n= 4 dollars that he uses to buy 4 chocolates at c= 1 dollar apiece, he can
#   trade in the 4 wrappers to buy 2 more chocolates. Now he has 2 more wrappers that he can trade in for 1 more
#   chocolate. Because he only has 1 wrapper left at this point and 1 < m, he was only able to eat a total of
#   7 pieces of chocolate.
#   Given n, c, and m for t trips to the store, can you determine how many chocolates Bobby eats during each trip?
#
#   Input Format
#   The first line contains an integer t, denoting the number of trips Bobby makes to the store.
#   Each line i of the t subsequent lines contains three space-separated integers describing
#   the respective n, c, and m values for one of Bobby's trips to the store.
#
#   Constraints
#   1 <= t <= 1000
#   2 <= n <= 10^5
#   1 <= c <= n
#   2 <= m <= n
#
#   Output Format
#   For each trip to Penny Auntie, print the total number of chocolates Bobby eats on a new line.
#
#   Sample Input
#   3
#   10 2 5
#   12 4 4
#   6 2 2
#
#   Sample Output
#   6
#   3
#   5
#
#   Explanation
#   Bobby makes the following 3 trips to the store:
#       - He spends his 10 dollars on 5 chocolates at 2 dollars apiece. He then eats them and exchanges all 5 wrappers
#           to get 1 more chocolate. We print the total number of chocolates he ate, which is 6.
#       - He spends his 12 dollars on 3 chocolates at 4 dollars apiece; however, he needs 4 wrappers to trade for his
#           next chocolate. Because he only has 3 wrappers, he cannot purchase or trade for any more chocolates.
#           We print the total number of chocolates he ate, which is 3.
#       - He spends 6 dollars on 3 chocolates at 2 dollars apiece. He then exchanges 2 of the 3 wrappers for 1
#           additional piece of chocolate. Next, he uses his third leftover chocolate wrapper from his initial
#           purchase with the wrapper from his trade-in to do a second trade-in for 1 more piece of chocolate.
#           At this point he has 1 wrapper left, which is not enough to perform another trade-in.
#           We print the total number of chocolates he ate, which is 5.
