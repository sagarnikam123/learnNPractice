# Bon AppÃ©tit

#######################################################################################################################
#
#   Anna and Brian order n items at a restaurant, but Anna declines to eat any of the kth item (where 0 <= k <n ) due
#   to an allergy. When the check comes, they decide to split the cost of all the items they shared; however, Brian
#   may have forgotten that they didn't split the kth item and accidentally charged Anna for it.
#   You are given n, k, the cost of each of the n items, and the total amount of money that Brian charged Anna for her
#   portion of the bill. If the bill is fairly split, print Bon Appetit; otherwise, print the amount of money that
#   Brian must refund to Anna.
#
#   Input Format
#   The first line contains two space-separated integers denoting the respective values of n
#   (the number of items ordered) and k(the 0-based index of the item that Anna did not eat).
#   The second line contains n space-separated integers where each integer i denotes the cost c[i],
#       of item i (where 0 <= i < n).
#   The third line contains an integer bcharged , denoting the amount of money that Brian charged Anna
#       for her share of the bill.
#
#   Constraints
#   2 <= n <= 10^5
#   0 <= k < n
#   0 <= c[i] <= 10^4
#   0 <= b <= Summation(c[i])
#
#   Output Format
#   If Brian did not overcharge Anna, print Bon Appetit on a new line; otherwise, print the difference
#   (i.e. bcharged - bactual) that Brian must refund to Anna (it is guaranteed that this will always be an integer).
#
#   Sample Input 0
#   4 1
#   3 10 2 9
#   12
#
#   Sample Output 0
#   5
#
#   Explanation 0
#   Anna didn't eat item c[1]= 10 , but she shared the rest of the items with Brian. The total cost of the shared
#   items is 3 +2 +9 = 14 and, split in half, the cost per person is bactual =7. Brian charged her bcharged for her
#   portion of the bill, which is more than the 7 dollars worth of food that she actually shared with him.
#   Thus, we print the amount Anna was overcharged, bcharged - bactual= 12 -7 = 5, on a new line.
#
#   Sample Input 1
#   4 1
#   3 10 2 9
#   7
#
#   Sample Output 1
#   Bon Appetit
#
#   Explanation 1
#   Anna didn't eat item c[1] = 10, but she shared the rest of the items with Brian. The total cost of the shared
#   items is a 3+2+9= 14nd, split in half, the cost per person is bactual=7. Because this matches the amount
#   bcharged=7, that Brian charged Anna for her portion of the bill, we print Bon Appetit on a new line.
