# Set .difference() Operation

#######################################################################################################################
#
#   .difference()
#   The tool .difference() returns a set with all the elements from the set that are not in an iterable.
#   Sometimes the - operator is used in place of the .difference() tool,
#   but it only operates on the set of elements in set.
#   Set is immutable to the .difference() operation (or the - operation).
#
#   >>> s = set("Hacker")
#   >>> print s.difference("Rank")
#   set(['c', 'r', 'e', 'H'])
#
#   >>> print s.difference(set(['R', 'a', 'n', 'k']))
#   set(['c', 'r', 'e', 'H'])
#
#   >>> print s.difference(['R', 'a', 'n', 'k'])
#   set(['c', 'r', 'e', 'H'])
#
#   >>> print s.difference(enumerate(['R', 'a', 'n', 'k']))
#   set(['a', 'c', 'r', 'e', 'H', 'k'])
#
#   >>> print s.difference({"Rank":1})
#   set(['a', 'c', 'e', 'H', 'k', 'r'])
#
#   >>> s - set("Rank")
#   set(['H', 'c', 'r', 'e'])
