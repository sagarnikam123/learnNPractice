# Matrix Script

#######################################################################################################################
#
#   Neo has a complex matrix script. The matrix script is a N X Mgrid of strings. It consists of alphanumeric
#   characters, spaces and symbols (!,@,#,$,%,&).
#
#   To decode the script, Neo needs to read each column and select only the alphanumeric characters and connect them.
#   Neo reads the column from top to bottom and starts reading from the leftmost column.
#   If there are symbols or spaces between two alphanumeric characters of the decoded script, then Neo replaces them
#   with a single space '' for better readability. Neo feels that there is no need to use 'if' conditions for decoding.
#   Alphanumeric characters consist of: [A-Z, a-z, and 0-9].
#
#   Input Format
#   The first line contains space-separated integers N (rows) and M (columns) respectively.
#   The next N lines contain the row elements of the matrix script.
#
#   Constraints
#   0 < N, M < 100
#
#   Note: A 0 score will be awarded for using 'if' conditions in your code.
#
#   Output Format
#   Print the decoded matrix script.
#
#   Sample Input
#   7 3
#   Tsi
#   h%x
#   i #
#   sM
#   $a
#   #t%
#   ir!
#
#   Sample Output
#   This is Matrix#  %!
#
#   Explanation
#   The decoded script is:
#
#   This$#is% Matrix#  %!
#
#   Neo replaces the symbols or spaces between two alphanumeric characters with
#   a single space   ' ' for better readability. So, the final decoded script is:
#
#   This is Matrix#  %!
