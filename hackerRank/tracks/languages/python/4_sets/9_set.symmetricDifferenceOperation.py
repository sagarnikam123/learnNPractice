# Set .symmetric_difference() Operation

#######################################################################################################################
#
#   .symmetric_difference()
#   The .symmetric_difference() operator returns a set with all the elements that are in the set and the iterable
#   but not both. Sometimes, a ^ operator is used in place of the .symmetric_difference() tool, but it only operates
#   on the set of elements in set. The set is immutable to the .symmetric_difference() operation (or ^ operation).
#
#   >>> s = set("Hacker")
#   >>> print s.symmetric_difference("Rank")
#   set(['c', 'e', 'H', 'n', 'R', 'r'])
#
#   >>> print s.symmetric_difference(set(['R', 'a', 'n', 'k']))
#   set(['c', 'e', 'H', 'n', 'R', 'r'])
#
#   >>> print s.symmetric_difference(['R', 'a', 'n', 'k'])
#   set(['c', 'e', 'H', 'n', 'R', 'r'])
#
#   >>> print s.symmetric_difference(enumerate(['R', 'a', 'n', 'k']))
#   set(['a', 'c', 'e', 'H', (0, 'R'), 'r', (2, 'n'), 'k', (1, 'a'), (3, 'k')])
#
#   >>> print s.symmetric_difference({"Rank":1})
#   set(['a', 'c', 'e', 'H', 'k', 'Rank', 'r'])
#
#   >>> s ^ set("Rank")
#   set(['c', 'e', 'H', 'n', 'R', 'r'])

#   Task
#   Students of District College have subscriptions to English and French newspapers. Some students have subscribed
#   to English only, some have subscribed to French only, and some have subscribed to both newspapers.
#   You are given two sets of student roll numbers. One set has subscribed to the English newspaper, and one set has
#   subscribed to the French newspaper. Your task is to find the total number of students who have subscribed
#   to either the English or the French newspaper but not both.
#
#   Input Format
