# Counting Sort 3

#######################################################################################################################
#
#   In the previous challenge, it was easy to print all the integers in order, since you did not have to access the
#   original list. Once you had obtained the frequencies of all the integers, you could simply print each integer
#   in order the correct number of times. However, if there is other data associated with an element, you will have
#   to access the original element itself.
#   In the final counting sort challenge, you are required to print the data associated with each integer. This means,
#   you will go through the original array to get the data, and then use some "helper arrays" to determine where to
#   place everything in a sorted array.
#   If you know the frequencies of each element, you know how many times to place it, but which index will you start
#   placing it from? It will be helpful to create a helper array for the "starting values" of each element.
#
#   Challenge
#   You will be given a list that contains both integers and strings. In this challenge you just care about the
#   integers. For every value i from 0 to 99, can you output L,
#   the number of elements that are less than or equal to i?
#
#   Input Format
#   - n , the size of the list ar.
#   - n lines follow, each containing an integer x and a string s.
#
#   Output Format
#   Output L for all numbers from 0 to 99 (inclusive).
#
#   Constraints
#   1 <= n <= 1000000
#   0 <= x < 100, x E(belongs to) ar
#   length of string <= 10

#
#   Explanation
#   0 appears 1 time, so the 0th number is 1.
#   0 and 1 combined appear 3 times, so the next number is 3.
#   This continues for the rest of the list, until no more new numbers appear.
