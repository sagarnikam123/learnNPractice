# Alternating Characters

#######################################################################################################################
#
#   Shashank likes strings in which consecutive characters are different. For example, he likes ABABA, while he
#   doesn't like ABAA. Given a string containing characters A and B only, he wants to change it into a string he
#   likes. To do this, he is allowed to delete the characters in the string.
#   Your task is to find the minimum number of required deletions.
#
#   Input Format
#   The first line contains an integer T, i.e. the number of test cases.
#   The next T lines contain a string each.
#
#   Output Format
#   For each test case, print the minimum number of deletions required.
#
#   Constraints
#   1 <= T <= 10
#   1 <= length of string <= 10^5
#
#   Sample Input
#   5
#   AAAA
#   BBBBB
#   ABABABAB
#   BABABA
#   AAABBB
#
#   Sample Output
#   3
#   4
#   0
#   0
#   4
#
#   Explanation
#   AAAA -> A, 3 deletions
#   BBBBB -> B, 4 deletions
#   ABABABAB -> ABABABAB, 0 deletions
#   BABABA -> BABABA, 0 deletions
#   AAABBB -> AB, 4 deletions because to convert it to AB we need to delete 2 A's and 2 B's
