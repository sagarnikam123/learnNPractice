# Manasa and Stones

#######################################################################################################################
#
#   Manasa is out on a hike with friends. She finds a trail of stones with numbers on them. She starts following the
#   trail and notices that two consecutive stones have a difference of either a or b. Legend has it that there is a
#   treasure trove at the end of the trail and if Manasa can guess the value of the last stone, the treasure would
#   be hers. Given that the number on the first stone was 0,
#   find all the possible values for the number on the last stone.
#   Note: The numbers on the stones are in increasing order.
#
#   Input Format
#   The first line contains an integer T, i.e. the number of test cases. T test cases follow; each has 3 lines.
#   The first line contains n (the number of stones). The second line contains a, and the third line contains b.
#
#   Output Format
#   Space-separated list of numbers which are the possible values of the last stone in increasing order.
#
#   Constraints
#   1 <= T <= 10
#   1 <= n,a,b <= 10^3
#
#   Sample Input
#   2
#   3
#   1
#   2
#   4
#   10
#   100
#
#   Sample Output
#   2 3 4
#   30 120 210 300
#
#   Explanation
#   All possible series for the first test case are given below:
#       1 0,1,2
#       2 0,1,3
#       3 0,2,3
#       4 0,2,4
#   Hence the answer 2 3 4.
#
#   Series with different number of final steps for second test case are the following:
#       1 0, 10, 20, 30
#       2 0, 10, 20, 120
#       3 0, 10, 110, 120
#       4 0, 10, 110, 210
#       5 0, 100, 110, 120
#       6 0, 100, 110, 210
#       7 0, 100, 200, 210
#       8 0, 100, 200, 300
#   Hence the answer 30 120 210 300.
