# Sherlock and Valid String

#######################################################################################################################
#
#   You know my powers, my dear Watson, and yet at the end of three months I was forced to confess that I had at
#   last met an antagonist who was my intellectual equal.
#   A "valid" string is a string S such that for all distinct characters in S each such character occurs
#   the same number of times in S.
#   For example, aabb is a valid string because the frequency of both characters a and b is 2, whereas aabbc is
#   not a valid string because the frequency of characters a, b, and c is not the same.
#   Watson gives a string S to Sherlock and asks him to remove some characters from the string such
#   that the new string is a "valid" string.
#   Sherlock wants to know from you if it's possible to be done with less than or equal to one removal.
#
#   Input Format
#   The first and only line contains S, the string Watson gives to Sherlock.
#
#   Constraints
#   1 <= | S | <= 10^5
#       String S contains lowercase letters only (a-z).
#
#   Output Format
#   Output YES if string S can be converted to a "valid" string by removing less than or equal to one character.
#   Else, output NO.
#
#   Sample Input
#   aabbcd
#
#   Sample Output
#   NO
#
#   Explanation
#   2 is the minimum number of removals required to make it a valid string. It can be done in following two ways:
#   Remove c and d to get aabb.
#   Or remove a and b to get abcd.
