# ACM ICPC Team

#######################################################################################################################
#
#   You are given a list of N people who are attending ACM-ICPC World Finals. Each of them are either well versed
#   in a topic or they are not. Find out the maximum number of topics a 2-person team can know. And also find out
#   how many teams can know that maximum number of topics.
#   Note Suppose a, b, and c are three different people, then (a,b) and (b,c) are counted as two different teams.
#
#   Input Format
#   The first line contains two integers N and M, separated by a single space,
#   where N represents the number of people, and M represents the number of topics. N lines follow.
#   Each line contains a binary string of length M. If the ith line's jth character is 1, then the ith person
#   knows the jth topic; otherwise, he doesn't know the topic.
#
#   Constraints
#   2 <= N <= 500
#   1 <= M <= 500
#
#   Output Format
#   On the first line, print the maximum number of topics a 2-person team can know.
#   On the second line, print the number of 2-person teams that can know the maximum number of topics.
#
#   Sample Input
#   4 5
#   10101
#   11100
#   11010
#   00101
#
#   Sample Output
#   5
#   2
#
#   Explanation
#   (1, 3) and (3, 4) know all the 5 topics.
#   So the maximal topics a 2-person team knows is 5, and only 2 teams can achieve this.
