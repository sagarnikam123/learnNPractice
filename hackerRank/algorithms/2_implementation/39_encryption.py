# Encryption

#######################################################################################################################
#
#   An English text needs to be encrypted using the following encryption scheme.
#   First, the spaces are removed from the text. Let L be the length of this text.
#   Then, characters are written into a grid, whose rows and columns have the following constraints:
#
#       |_ sq.root(L) _| <= rows <= column <= |-sq.root(L)-| , where |_ x _| is floor function and |- x - | is ceil function
#
#   For example, the sentence if man was meant to stay on the ground god would have given us roots after removing spaces
#   is 54 characters long, so it is written in the form of a grid with 7 rows and 8 columns.
#
#   ifmanwas
#   meanttos
#   tayonthe
#   groundgo
#   dwouldha
#   vegivenu
#   sroots
#
#       Ensure that rows x columns >= L
#       If multiple grids satisfy the above conditions, choose the one with the minimum area, i.e. rows x columns.
#
#   The encoded message is obtained by displaying the characters in a column, inserting a space, and then displaying
#   the next column and inserting a space, and so on. For example, the encoded message for the above rectangle is:
#
#   imtgdvs fearwer mayoogo anouuio ntnnlvt wttddes aohghn sseoau
#
#   You will be given a message in English with no spaces between the words.
#   The maximum message length can be 81 characters. Print the encoded message.
#
#   Here are some more examples:
#
#   Sample Input:
#   haveaniceday
#
#   Sample Output:
#   hae and via ecy
#
#   Sample Input:
#   feedthedog
#
#   Sample Output:
#   fto ehg ee dd

#   Sample Input:
