# Save the Prisoner!

#######################################################################################################################
#
#   A jail has N prisoners, and each prisoner has a unique id number S ranging from 1 to N. There are M sweets that
#   must be distributed to the prisoners. The jailer decides the fairest way to do this is by sitting the prisoners
#   down in a circle (ordered by ascending S), and then, starting with some random S, distribute one candy at a time
#   to each sequentially numbered prisoner until all M candies are distributed. For example, if the jailer picks
#   prisoner S=2, then his distribution order would be (2,3,4,5,....,n-1,n,1,2,3,4,...)
#   until all M sweets are distributed. But wait—there's a catch—the very last sweet is poisoned!
#   Can you find and print the ID number of the last prisoner to receive a sweet so he can be warned?
#
#   Input Format
#   The first line contains an integer T, denoting the number of test cases.
#   The T subsequent lines each contain 3 space-separated integers:
#   N (the number of prisoners), M (the number of sweets), and S (the prisoner ID), respectively.
#
#   Constraints
#   1 <= T <= 100
#   1 <= N <= 10^9
#   1 <= M <= 10^9
#   1 <= S <= 10^9
#
#   Output Format
#   For each test case, print the ID number of the prisoner who receives the poisoned sweet on a new line.
#
#   Sample Input
#   1
#   5 2 1
#
#   Sample Output
#   2
#
#   Explanation
#   There are N = 5 prisoners and M = 2 sweets. Distribution starts at ID number S = 1, so prisoner 1 gets the first
#   sweet and prisoner 2 gets the second (last) sweet. Thus, we must warn prisoner 2 about the poison,
#   so we print 2 on a new line.
