# Taum and B'day

#######################################################################################################################
#
#   Taum is planning to celebrate the birthday of his friend, Diksha. There are two types of gifts that Diksha
#   wants from Taum: one is black and the other is white. To make her happy, Taum has to buy B number of black gifts
#   and W number of white gifts.
#       - The cost of each black gift is X units.
#       - The cost of every white gift is Y units.
#       - The cost of converting each black gift into white gift or vice versa is Z units.
#
#   Help Taum by deducing the minimum amount he needs to spend on Diksha's gifts.
#
#   Input Format
#   The first line will contain an integer T which will be the number of test cases.
#   There will be T pairs of lines. The first line of each test case will contain the values of integers B and W.
#   Another line of each test case will contain the values of integers X, Y, and Z.
#
#   Constraints
#   1 <= T <= 10
#   0 < X,Y,Z,B,W <= 10^9
#
#   Output Format
#   T lines, each containing an integer: the minimum amount of units Taum needs to spend on gifts.
#
#   Sample Input
#   5
#   10 10
#   1 1 1
#   5 9
#   2 3 4
#   3 6
#   9 1 1
#   7 7
#   4 2 1
#   3 3
#   1 9 2
#
#   Sample Output
#   20
#   37
#   12
#   35
#   12
#
#   Explanation
#       Sample Case #01:
#       There is no benefit to converting the white gifts into black or the black gifts into white, so Taum will
#       have to buy each gift for 1 unit. So cost of buying all gifts will be: 10 * 1 + 10 * 1= 20.
#
#       Sample Case #02:
#       Again, we can't decrease the cost of black or white gifts by converting colors. We will buy gifts at their
#       original price. So cost of buying all gifts will be: 5 * 2 + 9 * 3 = 10 + 27 = 37.
#
#       Sample Case #03:
#       We will buy white gifts at their original price 1. For black gifts, we will first buy white one and color them
#       to black, so that their cost will be reduced to 1+1 = 2.
#       So cost of buying all gifts will be: 3 * 2 + 6 * 1 = 12.
#
#       Sample Case #04:
#       Similarly, we will buy white gifts at their original price, 2. For black gifts, we will first buy white one
#       and color them to black, so that their cost will be reduced to 2 + 1 = 3.
#       So cost of buying all gifts will be: 7 * 3 + 7 * 2 = 35.
#
#       Sample Case #05: We will buy black gifts at their original price 1. For white gifts, we will first black
#       gifts worth unit 1 and color them to white with another 2 units, so cost for white gifts is reduced to 3
#       units. So cost of buying all gifts will be: 3 * 1 + 3 * 3 = 3 + 9 = 12.
