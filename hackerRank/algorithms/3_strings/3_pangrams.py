# Pangrams

#######################################################################################################################
#
#   Roy wanted to increase his typing speed for programming contests. So, his friend advised him to type the sentence
#   "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog" repeatedly, because it is a pangram. (Pangrams are sentences
#   constructed by using every letter of the alphabet at least once.)
#   After typing the sentence several times, Roy became bored with it. So he started to look for other pangrams.
#   Given a sentence s, tell Roy if it is a pangram or not.
#
#   Input Format
#   Input consists of a string s.
#
#   Constraints
#   Length of s can be at most 10^3 (1 <= |s| <= 10^3) and it may contain spaces, lower case and upper case letters.
#   Lower-case and upper-case instances of a letter are considered the same.
#
#   Output Format
#   Output a line containing pangram if s is a pangram, otherwise output not pangram.
#
#   Sample Input
#   Input #1
#   We promptly judged antique ivory buckles for the next prize
#
#   Input #2
#   We promptly judged antique ivory buckles for the prize
#
#   Sample Output
#   Output #1
#   pangram
#
#   Output #2
#   not pangram
#
#   Explanation
#   In the first test case,
#   the answer is pangram because the sentence contains all the letters of the English alphabet.
