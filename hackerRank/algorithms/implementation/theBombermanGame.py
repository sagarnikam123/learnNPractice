# The Bomberman Game

#######################################################################################################################
#
#   Bomberman lives in a rectangular grid with R rows and C columns. Each cell in the grid either contains a bomb
#   or nothing at all. Each bomb can be planted in any cell of the grid but, once planted, it will detonate after
#   exactly 3 seconds. Once a bomb detonates, it's destroyed â€” along with anything in its four neighboring cells.
#   This means that if a bomb detonates in cell i,j cells (i +- 1, j)and (i, j +- 1)are cleared (note that cells at
#   the edge of the grid have less than four neighboring cells). If there is a bomb in a neighboring cell, the
#   neighboring bomb is destroyed without detonating (i.e., no chain reaction occurs).
#   Bomberman is immune to bombs, so he can move freely throughout the grid. Here's what he does:
#       - Initially, Bomberman arbitrarily plants bombs in some of the cells.
#       - After one second, Bomberman does nothing.
#       - After one more second, Bomberman plants bombs in all cells without bombs, thus filling the whole grid with
#               bombs. It is guaranteed that no bombs will detonate at this second.
#       - After one more second, any bombs planted exactly three seconds ago will detonate. Here,
#           Bomberman stands back and observes.
#       - Bomberman then repeats steps 3 and 4 indefinitely.
#
#   Note that during every second Bomberman plants bombs, the bombs are planted simultaneously (i.e., at the exact
#   same moment), and any bombs planted at the same time will detonate at the same time.
#   Given the initial configuration of the grid with the locations of Bomberman's first batch of planted bombs,
#   determine the state of the grid after N seconds.
#
#   Input Format
#   The first line contains three space-separated integers denoting the respective values of R, C, and N.
#   Each line i of the R subsequent lines describes row i of the grid's initial state as a single string of
#   C characters; the . character denotes an empty cell, and the O character (ascii 79) denotes a bomb.
#
#   Constraints
#   1 <= R,C <= 200
#   1 <= N <= 10^9
#
#   Subtask
#   1 <= N <= 200 for 40% of the maximum score.
#
#   Output Format
#   Print the grid's final state. This means R lines where each line contains C characters, and each character is
#   either a . or an O (ascii 79). This grid must represent the state of the grid after N seconds.
#
#   Sample Input
#   6 7 3
#   .......
#   ...O...
#   ....O..
#   .......
#   OO.....
#   OO.....
#
#   Sample Output
#   OOO.OOO
#   OO...OO
#   OOO...O
#   ..OO.OO
#   ...OOOO
#   ...OOOO
#
#   Explanation
#   The initial state of the grid is:
#   .......
#   ...O...
#   ....O..
#   .......
#   OO.....
#   OO.....
#
#   Bomberman spends the first second doing nothing, so this is the state after 1 second:
#   .......
#   ...O...
#   ....O..
#   .......
#   OO.....
#   OO.....
#
#   Bomberman plants bombs in all the empty cells during his second second, so this is the state after 2 seconds:
#   OOOOOOO
#   OOOOOOO
#   OOOOOOO
#   OOOOOOO
#   OOOOOOO
#   OOOOOOO
#
#   In his third second, Bomberman sits back and watches all the bombs he planted 3 seconds ago detonate. This is the
#   final state after 3 seconds:
#   OOO.OOO
#   OO...OO
#   OOO...O
#   ..OO.OO
#   ...OOOO
#   ...OOOO
