# Quicksort In-Place

#######################################################################################################################
#
#   The previous version of Quicksort was easy to understand, but it was not optimal. It required copying the
#   numbers into other arrays, which takes up space and time. To make things faster, one can create an "in-place"
#
#   version of Quicksort, where the numbers are all sorted within the array itself.
#   Challenge
#   Create an in-place version of Quicksort. You need to follow Lomuto Partitioning method.
#   Guideline
#   Instead of copying the array into multiple sub-arrays, use indices to keep track of the different sub-arrays.
#   You can pass the indices to a modified partition method. The partition method should partition the sub-array and
#   then return the index location where the pivot gets placed,
#   so you can then call partition on each side of the pivot.
#       Always select the last element in the 'sub-array' as a pivot.
#       Partition the left side and then the right side of the sub-array.
#       Print out the whole array at the end of every partitioning method.
#       An array of length 1 or less will be considered sorted, and there is no need to sort or to print them.
#   Since you cannot just create new sub-arrays for the elements, partition method will need to use another trick
#   to keep track of which elements are greater and which are lower than the pivot.
#
#   The In-place Trick
#       If an element is lower than the pivot, you should swap it with a larger element on the left-side of the sub-array.
#       Greater elements should remain where they are.
#       At the end of the partitioning method, the pivot should be swapped with the first element of the right
#       partition, consisting of all larger elements, of the sub-array.
#       To ensure that you don't swap a small element with another small element, use an index to keep track of the
#       small elements that have already been swapped into their "place".

#
#   Input Format
#   There will be two lines of input:
#       n - the size of the array
#       ar - the n numbers of the array
#
#   Output Format
#   Print the entire array on a new line at the end of every partitioning method.
#
#   Constraints
#   1 <= n <= 5000
#   -1000 <= x <= 10000, x E(belongs to) ar
#   There are no duplicate numbers.
#
#   Sample Input
#   7
#   1 3 9 8 2 7 5
#
#   Sample Output
#   1 3 2 5 9 7 8
#   1 2 3 5 9 7 8
#   1 2 3 5 7 8 9
#
#   Explanation
#   5 is initally selected as the pivot, and the array is partitioned as shown in the diagram. The left side is
#   partitioned next with 2 as the pivot. Finally, the right side is partitioned with 8 as the pivot.
#   The entire array is now sorted.
