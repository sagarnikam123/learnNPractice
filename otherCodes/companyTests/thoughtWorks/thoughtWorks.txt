|	ThouthWorks Problems	|
=============================
		
Thanks again for your interest in ThoughtWorks. Enclosed are two programming problems. We ask that
you read both the descriptions thoroughly then create a program to solve **ONE** of the problems. If you
choose to do both the problems, we will choose and evaluate only one of your solutions.

· For the solution, we would want you use either Java, Ruby or C#.

· We will assess a number of things including the design aspect of your solution and your object oriented programming skills.
Whilst these are small problems, we expect you to submit what you believe is “production-quality” code that you would be able to run, maintain and evolve. You don’t need to “gold plate” your solution, but we are looking for something more than a bare-bones algorithm. You should submit code that you would be happy to produce in a real project, or that you would be happy to receive from a colleague.

· You may use external libraries or tools for building or testing purposes.
Specifically, you may use unit testing libraries or build tools available for your chosen language (e.g., JUnit, Ant, NUnit, NAnt, Test::Unit, Rake etc.)

· Optionally, you may also include a brief explanation of your design and assumptions along with your code.

· Kindly note that we are NOT expecting a web-based application or a comprehensive UI.
Rather, we are expecting a simple, console based application and interested in your source code.
 
Notes for C# developers:
· For security reasons, please do NOT submit your C# code as a .msi file.
· For convenience of reviewing, we request you NOT to use regions in the code.

PLEASE USE THE URL BELOW TO SUBMIT YOUR CODE:
http://jobs.thoughtworks.com/DataCompletionRequest?uid=OBr-b5k2ltdDHY7F&jobId=739
  
 Please do not include any other files or executables**, as certain files will be blocked for security purposes.
 ** Executables are : asp, bat, class, cmd, com, cpl, dll, exe, fon, hta, ini, ins, iw, jar, jsp, js, jse, pif, scr, shs, sh, vb, vbe, vbs, ws, wsc, wsf, wsh
 
As a general rule, we allow three days from the date that you receive this letter to submit your code, 
but you may request more time from your recruiter if needed.
If you have any questions about the code as it relates to your interview process, please contact your recruiter.

|	INTRODUCTION TO THE PROBLEMS	|
=====================================

All problems below require some kind of input. You are free to implement any mechanism for feeding
input into your solution (for example, using hard coded data within a unit test). You should provide
sufficient evidence that your solution is complete by, as a minimum, indicating that it works correctly
against the supplied test data.

|	PROBLEM ONE: MERCHANT'S GUIDE TO THE GALAXY	|
=================================================
You decided to give up on earth after the latest financial collapse left 99.99% of the earth's population with 0.01% of the wealth. Luckily, with the scant sum of money that is left in your account, you are able to afford to rent a spaceship, leave earth, and fly all over the galaxy to sell common metals and dirt (which apparently is worth a lot).Buying and selling over the galaxy requires you to convert numbers and units, and you decided to write a program to help you.The numbers used for intergalactic transactions follows similar convention to the roman numerals and you have painstakingly collected the appropriate translation between them.Roman numerals are based on seven symbols:

Symbol	Value
I	1
V	5
X	10
L	50
C	100
D	500
M	1,000

Numbers are formed by combining symbols together and adding the values. For example, MMVI is 1000 + 1000 + 5 + 1 = 2006. Generally, symbols are placed in order of value, starting with the largest values. When smaller values precede larger values, the smaller values are subtracted from the larger values, and the result is added to the total. For example MCMXLIV = 1000 + (1000 - 100) + (50 - 10) + (5 - 1) = 1944.
The symbols "I", "X", "C", and "M" can be repeated three times in succession, but no more. (They may appear four times if the third and fourth are separated by a smaller value, such as XXXIX.) "D", "L", and "V" can never be repeated.
"I" can be subtracted from "V" and "X" only. "X" can be subtracted from "L" and "C" only. "C" can be subtracted from "D" and "M" only. "V", "L", and "D" can never be subtracted.
Only one small-value symbol may be subtracted from any large-value symbol.
A number written in Arabic numerals can be broken into digits. For example, 1903 is composed of 1, 9, 0, and 3. To write the Roman numeral, each of the non-zero digits should be treated separately. In the above example, 1,000 = M, 900 = CM, and 3 = III. Therefore, 1903 = MCMIII.
-- Source: Wikipedia (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_numerals)Input to your program consists of lines of text detailing your notes on the conversion between intergalactic units and roman numerals. You are expected to handle invalid queries appropriately.

Test input:
glob is I
prok is V
pish is X
tegj is L
glob glob Silver is 34 Credits
glob prok Gold is 57800 Credits
pish pish Iron is 3910 Credits
how much is pish tegj glob glob ?
how many Credits is glob prok Silver ?
how many Credits is glob prok Gold ?
how many Credits is glob prok Iron ?
how much wood could a woodchuck chuck if a woodchuck could chuck wood ?

Test Output:
pish tegj glob glob is 42
glob prok Silver is 68 Credits
glob prok Gold is 57800 Credits
glob prok Iron is 782 Credits
I have no idea what you are talking about

|	PROBLEM TWO: CONFERENCE TRACK MANAGEMENT	|
=================================================
You are planning a big programming conference and have received many proposals which have passed the initial screen process 
but you're having trouble fitting them into the time constraints of the day -- 
there are so many possibilities! So you write a program to do it for you.

· The conference has multiple tracks each of which has a morning and afternoon session.
· Each session contains multiple talks.
· Morning sessions begin at 9am and must finish by 12 noon, for lunch.
· Afternoon sessions begin at 1pm and must finish in time for the networking event.
· The networking event can start no earlier than 4:00 and no later than 5:00.
· No talk title has numbers in it.
· All talk lengths are either in minutes (not hours) or lightning (5 minutes).
· Presenters will be very punctual; there needs to be no gap between sessions.

Note that depending on how you choose to complete this problem, your solution may give a different ordering or combination of talks into tracks. 
This is acceptable; you don’t need to exactly duplicate the sample output given here.
