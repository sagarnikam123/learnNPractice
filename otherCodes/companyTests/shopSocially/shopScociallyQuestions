=================
* Number of questions: 4
* Has a time limit of: 03:00:00
* Must be finished in one sitting. You cannot save and finish later.
* Questions displayed per page: 3
* Will allow you to go back and change your answers.
* Will not let you finish with any questions unattempted.

This  a test with 4 programming problems. You have up to 4 hours to solve these questions.
The purpose of this test is to evaluate how to think and structure your programs.
You can solve the programming problems on your computer in any programming language of your choice. 
At ShopSocially, we code in Python, but you can choose any language.
Write the program, compile it on your machine and make sure that the results are accurate. 
Store the output results in a file.
Once you are done, zip the original source code and the output results files and email them to shivang@shopsocially.com. 
Once we study your code and the results, we will get a good understanding of your programming skills.

Good luck!

|	Question 1 of 4	|
=====================
You need to consume the API from twitter (https://dev.twitter.com) for this question. 
Write a script which will take an input from the user. 
The input will be any arbitrary string which will be a twitter hashtag 
[The user can enter any string which should be construed as a hashtag. Examples - #wolfofwallstreet, #socialcommerce etc]. 
Your script should pull the tweets which has pictures for the given hashtag and print the first 20 tweets.
---------------------
This script should be a stand-alone script and should be able to run from the command line.

"Top Words" Programming Problem


You are given a list of words (one word per line) and there can be repetitive words. 
Let's call this list of words word_list. You are given another input word (let's call this input_word).

The number of times a word appears in the word_list is called the weight of the word. 
Your program should print the top 5 words in the word_list which begin with the input_word in order of decreasing weights.

· If there are less than 5 words in the word_list which begin with the input_word then print as many as possible.

· If the weights of two words in the word_list are equal, then print them in the order of the first occurrence of the word.

· If there are no matching words, then print NULL.

We give an example below-

Suppose the word_list is ['shop', 'social', 'shop', 'socially', 'shop', 'social', 'cafepress', 'commissionjunction', 'stripe', 'socially', 'commissionjunction', 'stripe', 'socially', 'shop', 'cafepress'].

Let the input_word be s. So the output would be -

shop
socially
social
stripe
 
Note that only 4 words are printed above as there are only 4 matching words. You have to read from the standard input and write to the standard output. The first line of the input will be a number N which denotes the number of words in the word_list. The next N lines will contain one word per line which are the words are in the word_list. After the N lines, there will be a word in the next line which will be the input_word. The output should contain the words one per line.

Input

15

shop

social

shop

socially

shop

social

cafepress

commissionjunction

stripe

socially

commissionjunction

stripe

socially

shop

cafepress

s


Output:

shop

socially

social

stripe


NB - Accuracy is more important than speed.
Note: Please ignore the text box below. You can solve this problem separately on your computer.

=====================
"Counting Couples" Programming Problem

Your program should read a string from the standard input, find out the number of couples in the string and print that number on the standard output.

A couple are a group of two same characters which are found together or can be found by removing other couples from the string. 

Consider the following sequence of string manipulations to find the number of couples in a string.

abccba - The original string

abccba - cc is a couple as they occur together. Remove this couple and count as 1 couple.

abba - Resulting string after removing the above couple

abba - bb is a couple as they occur together. Remove this couple and count as 2 couples.

aa - Resulting string after removing the above couple

aa - aa is a couple as they occur together. Remove this couple and count as 3 couples.

So there are 3 couples in the original string. So, the output must be 3.


Points to note - 

· You might find that there are no couples in a given string. In this case, the output must be 0.

· In the above example, the string was completely exhausted as all the characters were part of a couple. This might not be the case in all the input strings.

The input will contain a single line with the input string. Your program should print a number to standard output with just one integer denoting the number of couples in the input string.

=====================
"Find Duplicates" Programming Problem


Given a list of words, print all the words which occur more than once in the given list.

Input must be read from the standard input and must be printed to the standard output. 
The first line of the input has a number N which is the number of words in the initial list. 
The next N lines contains one word per line - these words makes the list.

Your program should then print the words which are duplicated. 
Your program should print one word per line to the standard output.
You will have to preserve the order in which the words had appeared.
For example, consider that the list is ['shop', 'socially', 'social', 'stripe', 'shop', 'socially']. 
So the output must be ['shop', 'socially']. 
Note here that 'shop' appears first in the output as it also appears first in the input list,
that is, it appears before 'socially' in the list (so the order is preserved).

Sample Input

6

shop

socially

social

stripe

shop

socially

 

Output

shop

socially
