# Getting Started with Prometheus

# Prometheus is an open source systems monitoring and alerting toolkit
# originally built at SoundCloud. Since its inception in 2012, many companies
# and organizations have adopted Prometheus, and the project has a very active
# developer and user community. It is now a standalone open source project
# and maintained independently of any company. To emphasize this and clarify
# the project's governance structure, Prometheus joined the Cloud Native Computing
# Foundation in 2016 as the second hosted project after Kubernetes.
# More details can be found at https://prometheus.io
